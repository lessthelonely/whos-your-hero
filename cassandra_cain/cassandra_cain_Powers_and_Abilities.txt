Unarmed Combat: Due to the harsh training she went through as a child, Cassandra is one of the greatest martial artists in the world and is a master assassin. Some of her feats include shattering brick and stone as well as a sword. She has used nerve strikes and pressure points. She has dodged bullets at point blank range and even disarmed a gunman before the bullet could hit her. She has invented her own styles and techniques. She can lift about twice her weight and carry 230 lbs while running.
Reading Body Language: She is skilled in being able to comprehend a person's body movements as if it were language or speech, and thus knows what actions a person will use before they actually do. Her ability to comprehend body language enables her to quickly learn new martial arts style, such as learning Escrima from a single sparring session with Oracle. After having her mind altered to think like a normal person, her ability to predict movements was lost. However, Lady Shiva retrained Cass to read body language.
Weakness Perception: Starting in The New 52 and going forward, Cassandra has the ability to see the weaknesses in almost any person or thing she sees. Because she sees everything in this way, she can assess the weaknesses she sees and determine how best to beat or kill a target in a matter of seconds. Combined with her ability to read body language, Cassandra can both determine a target's actions and calculate the best counterattack, making her more dangerous. This ability is a double-edged sword, though, as Cassandra is always aware of which weaknesses will kill her target and which won't. Because of her vow against killing, she constantly battles the impulse to kill her enemies outright. However, because she is always aware of the ways to kill her opponents, she has to willingly ignore those options and attack in a non-lethal fashion. This nature of holding back makes her think and act below her full capabilities, which hinders her when facing opponents on her level, such as her mother.
Intellect: Cassandra was given some detective training from Tim Drake while they were in Bl�dhaven.
Weapons-Master: She is also a master of different kinds of melee and ranged weaponry. Her time with Barbara Gordon and the Batman only enhanced her already considerable skills.Unarmed Combat: Due to the harsh training she went through as a child, Cassandra is one of the greatest martial artists in the world and is a master assassin.
