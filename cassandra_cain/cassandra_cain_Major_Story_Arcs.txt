Batgirl
As a child, she was trained by not just David Cain, but Bronze Tiger, Merlyn the archer, and Alpha, among many others. Cain kept her trained and focused on fighting, by never teaching her speech or reading. The parts of her brain normally used for speech were trained so she could read other people's movements and body language and predict , with uncanny accuracy, their next move. This also caused her brain to develop learning functions different from most, in a form of dyslexia that hampered her ability to read and write for years to come. Training her in a variety of secluded locations Cain recorded many of their sessions.When Cassandra was 5, Cain began taking her along on his hits so she could be cultured to accept death and killing as normal. At age 8 he decided she had progressed far enough to test her abilities in the real world of an assassin. He took her to a hit where she would hand out the killing blow; the target Faizul, would never see it coming. At the time however despite going along with her father's wishes she had no idea what she was doing; she may have even believed it was only a game however after striking the deathblow, she "read" the target as he died and knew in intimate detail what it meant to take a life. This experience left her scarred emotionally and she ran away from her father for what he had caused her to do. Cassandra spent the next nine years homeless as a wandering, mute drifter.Cassandra spent the next nine years homeless, beating herself up mentally over what she'd done as she traveled the world. Entering Gotham City during No Man's Land, Cassandra came to be a courier for Oracle, even picking up rare delicacies like apples alongside her missions. Oracle took her on as a student and tried to teach her how to read and write. Over time Barbara began to see that Cassie had training and skill, but had been abused in some way. Cassandra became involved with the Bat Family after seeing the handiwork of her father, Cain, and realizing that he planned to kill Commissioner Gordon, she confronted him and saved the Commissioner. She was given the Batgirl costume with the blessings of both Batman and Oracle.Usually going out under the Batman's watchful eye she was finally allowed to go on a solo mission when a patrol station needed guarding against a local gang. Near the end of No Man's Land Batman noticed her death wish and forced her to make a decision between suicidal actions and self preservation. She opted for self preservation.Cassandra works as Batgirl with Oracle, and they become a team to be reckoned with. On time they were trying to solve a bombing at the diamond exchange that killed several people. Two-Face caused the bombing and took credit for it but the problem was why did six of the bodies disappear. It turned out they were being reanimated and used by a man named Malcolm Greymater (The General) in his crime-syndicate known as the Trio. The machine that brought people back didn't really work on everyone's minds leaving some complete zombies while others with slight memory loss that just got worse as their brains rotted. Good looking women were taken to a strip club where they would perform. Strong men were recruited in his own gang.Everything led them to Arcadia where she and Oracle worked with the Ghost. Two-Face also went to Arcadia on a separate issue of revenge against the General as well. Everything ends with Two-Face and the General killing most of their own men and the base for the General is destroyed as well with him getting away talking about moving to Metropolis and setting up again.Cassie's desire for a family grows ever stronger as she continues to live with Oracle and watches the dynamics of the Bat Family. Information on her childhood continues to be gathered as she studies her father and his movements, suspicions of her mother's true identity begin to come to light and she decides against Batman's wishes to chase down Lady Shiva and confront her about her true parentage. Having faced Shiva once before the woman had hinted at her role in the child's upbringing trying to get the girl to fight her as Cassie's new training in speech and her telepathy had thrown her off balance, Cassandra barely defeated her with a cheap shot. Later, Cassandra then requested Shiva to retrain her to read people like her. Shiva accepted her offer, only on the condition that in one year, they would fight to the death.One year later, Cassandra and Shiva fight once more, with Shiva killing her in minutes. Shiva then restarts her heart, and learns that Cassandra had a death wish. After learning this, the two have a real fight, in which Cassandra wins.Following the trail she heads to the latest home of the League of Assassins, who were lead by Nyssa, Ra's al Ghul's daughter. While making her way into the compound, Cassie drops in upon Lady Shiva's training of the latest assassin recruits. Preparing to attack, she was stunned to see the recruits address her as: "One who is all", the one who defeated Shiva in combat. After Shiva explains why she is in league with The League of Assassins, she attacks Cassie. While Cassie tried to get Shiva to answer if she was her mother, the duel was interrupted when Mr. Freeze appeared and froze Cassie. Somehow, Cassie convinced Mr. Freeze to let her go in exchange, she would help him revive his wife, Nora.

Shiva told Cassie the story of her birth while the women fought, finally getting the battle she wanted Shiva continued to tell the story as Cassie fought back, telling of Cain's use of her, of how he killed her sister to get a rise out of her. That finally he did Shiva a favor as she was stronger and better than ever, that Cassie could be so as well. Finally, Cassie was able to defeat her once again, stabbing her through a chained hook leaving her to die above the Lazarus pit. Cassie, realizing who she was raised to be, handed the cowl back to Batman and quit being Batgirl.Robin goes to track down Cassandra after she disappeared from the Bat family and found her to be the new leader of the League of Assassins.

Cassandra was found to have been injected with a serum by Deathstroke that clouded her mind and judgment and forced her to obey his will. Robin tried to talk Cassandra down and offered his support to take her home, handing him a gun Cassie tells Robin to join her and kill her father to prove his worthiness an ordeal to which Robin refused. Cassie then, takes the gun and kills Cain herself, while he tells Robin that there are more girls like Cassie.
