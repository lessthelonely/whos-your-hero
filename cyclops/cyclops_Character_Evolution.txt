Since the founding of the X-Men, Cyclops has been a stalwart field leader and one of the most iconic members of the mutant team. Professor Xavier chose him as his successor to lead the X-Men and carry on his ideals, a heavy burden placed on Scott's shoulders from a young age. Over the years, he has grown from a taciturn young man who lacked confidence in himself and his abilities into a powerful and capable leader, becoming one of the most important figures in the Marvel Universe. Strong-willed, self-disciplined, and fearlessly loyal, Cyclops possesses tremendous leadership abilities and excellent tactical and strategic skills. In many ways, Cyclops is the X-Men, representing their core ideals. Cyclops's dedication towards making Xavier's dream of peaceful coexistence between mutants and humans a reality has been a driving force in his life for many years.Scott eventually emerged from Xavier's shadow as the X-Men's undisputed leader. He also became co-headmaster of the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning alongside his lover, Emma Frost. Succeeding Professor X as the authority figure of the X-Men caused a significant change in Cyclops's character. No longer defined by his strict adherence to Xavier's ideology, Cyclops has become far more confident, audacious, and pragmatic. As leader of the X-Men, he has had to embrace his own vision for the future of mutant-kind in a world that fears and hates them.
