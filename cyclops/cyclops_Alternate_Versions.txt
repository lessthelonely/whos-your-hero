Age of Apocalypse (Earth-295)
When Scott Summers was still a child, his father was flying the family to Canada when their plane was attacked by a Shi'ar spacecraft. Giving him the only parachute on board, Scott's father threw him and his younger brother Alex out of the aircraft and into the Canadian wilderness. The brothers were taken to an orphanage run by Mr. Sinister, who later adopted the two and considered them the closest thing he had found to genetic perfection.Scott quickly became Sinister's favorite, due to his strong genetics and ability to lead. This favoritism would strain the relationship between Scott and Alex, who grew jealous of his older brother. Unknown to both Scott or Alex, their real father had managed to escape from the Shi'ar and made his way back to Earth in a Shi'ar airship.Unfortunately, he was also infected with a Brood egg and his ship was captured by Apocalypse's forces. He was taken to the breeding pens, where he was experimented on by Henry McCoy for a number of years. Cyclops began to question the treatment of the prisoners in the breeding pens, and soon began to secretly release them. Jean Grey was captured by Cyclops during a mission with the X-Men and sent to Sinister's lab. However, Cyclops became attracted to Jean for her spirit and dedication.He contemplated returning Jean to her friends but Weapon X had infiltrated the labs and freed Jean himself, encountering Cyclops along the way. The two fought in a ferocious battle with Weapon X taking out Cyclops's left eye, while Cyclops in turn blasted off Weapon X's left hand. Both Jean and Weapon X managed to escape, but a bitter resentment remained between Cyclops and Weapon X.After five years of being experimented on, Christopher Summers managed to escape from the breeding pens, much to Sinister's chagrin. He ordered his recapture but told Alex and Scott to remain behind, which made Scott suspicious of the nature of this mission. After the search team's emergency beacon was picked up, Cyclops and Havok went to investigate in the Ghost Lands. There, they encountered their long lost father. Christopher told them the story of how they became separated, which was enough to convince Havok that he was telling the truth. Cyclops, however, wasn't so easily swayed.During a battle between some scavengers, Sinister came and rescued the Summers family. Unfortunately, the Brood egg that was inside of Christopher hatched and he proceeded to attack Sinister. Before he could cause any further harm, Christopher's consciousness became dominant and he begged Scott to kill him. Scott reluctantly complied and killed his father. This act caused a further rift between Scott and Alex, who now blamed him for the death of their father.Cyclops soon learned that Apocalypse's Horseman, Death, was trying to cause a mutiny and seize power for himself. Cyclops knew he had to make a stand and helped Blink free her captured teammates and release Sunfire from his prison. Blink teleported Cyclops and her teammates to safety as Sunfire incinerated Death. It was around this time that Sinister had created X-Man using both Scott and Jean as genetic templates, who were both unaware of this development. Sinister planned to use X-Man to overthrow Apocalypse as ruler.On one occasion, Cyclops came into contact with X-Man and tried to help him escape from the pens. However, the rash mutant refused his help and escaped the pens by himself. Both were unaware of their relationship to each other or that they were secretly being watched by Sinister himself. Cyclops also became increasingly concerned by Sinister's sudden disappearances. He broke into Sinister's lab and discovered the place had been trashed. Cyclops realized that Sinister had abandoned them and betrayed Apocalypse.Cyclops continued to rescue people from the breeding pens. Unfortunately, people began to suspect that something was amiss. They questioned a young mutant named Lorna Dane, who witnessed the previous nights escape. Unfortunately, Lorna had a fragile mind and thought she had witnessed Magneto rescuing the prisoners. Havok ordered that she be interrogated by the Dark Beast, but Cyclops stopped the torture and ordered her release back to the pens.That night, Cyclops broke into the pens, while in disguise, and rescued Lorna. However, his activities were detected by Northstar and Aurora. With his face hidden in the darkness, Cyclops attacked the twins and made his getaway. Meeting with a member of the underground at the Hudson River, Cyclops turned Lorna over to them. However, his face was no longer in disguise and his activities were being monitored by Havok from a distance. Jean returned to Sinister's lab in an attempt to locate him, but she was captured by Havok and sent to the Beast.Cyclops was stunned to see Jean again and when he refused Havok's order to kill her, Havok revealed that he knew Cyclops had been helping the prisoners escape from the pens. Cyclops was then captured and, along with Jean, tortured by the Beast. However, Jean used her psychic powers to remove Cyclops' visor and he released a concussive blast on the Beast, rendering him unconscious.Cyclops and Jean escaped and tried to free the prisoners in the breeding pens. However, Apocalypse had ordered that all of the prisoners be killed as a means to convey his message of survival of the fittest. Cyclops and Jean met with X-Man, who had come to bring an end to Apocalypse's rule. X-Man discovered that the two were his parents, while Jean and Scott both felt a strange connection to the boy. Scott and Jean then made their way to the Brain Trust, which had anesthetized the prisoners so that they lacked the will to escape.Jean used her psychic powers to destroy the Brain Trust as Cyclops ordered the Bedlam Brothers, who had also betrayed Apocalypse's rule, to disable the main generators and knock out all of the lights. As the prisoners escaped, Cyclops and Jean fought Havok. Cyclops managed to knock Havok unconscious, but could not bring himself to kill his brother. Cyclops and Jean then led the prisoners to safety, but Jean sensed that the Human High Council had unleashed bombs that were making their way towards Apocalypse's America.In an attempt to hold the bombs back, Jean blanketed the sky with a telekinetic shield. Havok had managed to track down Cyclops and Jean, and proceeded to slay Jean with his powers. Cyclops confronted his brother, but was defeated and nearly killed as well. As Havok gloated over the defeat of his brother, Weapon X killed him to avenge the death of his beloved.Weapon Omega has ascended as new ruler of Age of Apocalypse. Cyclops reappears as head minister of Famineï¿½s control, under the control of Weapon Omega. He was revived by Dark Beast and Sugar Man using the power of the Life Seed.

Later, Scott was rescued from a lynch mob by the mutant telepath Charles Xavier, who recruited him to be the first X-Man.He took the code name "Cyclops" and was outfitted with a dark blue and gold uniform standard to the initial X-Men. The suit, composed of high-tech latex and Kevlar, also acted as a cloaking device that disguised his mutant bio-signature from Sentinels. He could release an optic blast either by pressing on a button on either side of his visor, or by pressing a concealed button in the palm of his gloves.Scott became considerably infatuated with Jean Grey, codenamed "Marvel Girl", another prodigy of Professor Xavier. Prior to the X-Men's first mission it took Scott an entire year and a half to develop the courage to ask Jean out to go see a movie with him, according to Jean.Though shy and timid when it came to the subject of Jean Grey, Cyclops acted as the team's field leader, at first to the chagrin of newly recruited Colossus who cited Cyclops' age as he was a year younger than him.

After the X-Men's third mission, the rescue of the U.S. President's kidnapped daughter from the Brotherhood of Evil, Cyclops became disillusioned with the X-Men's goals. This was allegedly because of Xavier's dealings with an anti-mutant U.S. administration, but also because he had witnessed a mutual kiss between Marvel Girl and Wolverine.Cyclops then took the Blackbird, abandoned the X-Men, and joined the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. He participated in their bombings of Parliament and the MI6 building. When Magneto lead an army of Sentinels to Washington in retaliation for a government sponsored attack on the Savage Land, Cyclops quit the Brotherhood of Mutants and alerted the X-Men.

Professor Xavier tried to force the two to cooperate, sending them on a mission together to the Savage Land in order to find missing U.S. marines. There they faced a sentient computer and its army of cyborg zombies. While fleeing a collapsing underground complex, Wolverine chose to let Cyclops fall into a chasm.Cyclops survived the fall, albeit severely injured, and clung to life by eating grubs and worms to survive. After twenty-six days he was found by Brotherhood members, who failed to recognize him, and took him back to their new base for medical treatment. When Magneto plotted to reverse Earth's magnetic fields, Cyclops summoned the X-Men in time to stop him. Cyclops confronted Wolverine, and violently removed him from the team after blasting him to the ground.Months later, Cyclops invited Wolverine back, feeling it was his best chance to rehabilitate. Scott was reunited with his estranged brother Alex, who had joined Emma Frost's rival mutant educational program, the Academy of Tomorrow.
