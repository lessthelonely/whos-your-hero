    <hero:origin rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">David Cain trained Cassandra in isolation and kept her away from human speech, raising her on the language of motion and violence. The idea was to adapt the language centers of her brain, and train it to interpret physical movement as a language. This gifted Cassandra with superb body-reading abilities, and has made fighting her "mother tongue" so to speak. However, this upbringing has also rendered her dyslexic, and when taught to speak, with audible speech-impediments.When Cassandra was eight, Cain took her to carry out a hit in Macau. Cassandra did as her father trained and instructed her to do, and ripped out the throat of a local triad boss. Due to her body-reading ability, she was able to see how death effected the man, and was traumatized by her irreversible sin. Her father came to congratulate her, and she rejected him by delivering an emotional uppercut. Shocked, Cain did not pursue Cassandra when she fled in tears. Cassandra would then wander the Earth for the next eight years, before meeting her father once again in Gotham during No Man's Land.</hero:origin>

    <hero:evolution rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma Frost has transitioned from one of the X-Men's deadliest foes into a central figure on the side of the mutants. Her first era presented her as a leader in the Hellfire Club, but this ended when the manic time traveler Fitzroy appeared from the future, resulting in the deaths of many of her Hellions and putting Emma into a coma. Her involvement in the Phalanx Covenant arc led her to become co-teacher of the new Generation X team with Banshee. Later, after the end of the Generation X series, when the Sentinels devastated Genosha she gained a new power - her diamond form. Subsequent story arcs made her Cyclops' new partner and lover, and a former co-leader of the X-Men. She continues to play a prominent role in Cyclops' teams.</hero:evolution>

Emma brought a final element to the team: Namor, with whom she had previously shared a romantic relationship. Emma's first fight with the team occurred when she arrests a group of mutant vandals led by her own former student, Hellion.

He also tells her that the Omega Chair, developed by the Dark Beast has horrible side effects and that Osborn isn't telling her everything.

    <hero:origin rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Wally West was the nephew of Iris West, fiance of Barry Allen, who was (unknown to her at the time) the Flash of Central City. Wally grew up in a small town called Blue Valley with emotionally distant parents, and dreamed of living in Central City and perhaps one day meeting his hero, The Flash. Wally was only close to one relative, his father's sister, Iris.One summer, Iris offered to let Wally stay in Central City with her. Wally gladly took the chance to get out of his hometown and away from his parents, and looked forward to the excitement of the big city. Iris introduced Wally to Barry, whom Wally thought was dull and uninteresting until Barry offered to introduce Wally to the Flash.Barry used some simple super-speed tricks to pull off the double identity, and gave Wally the surprise of his life. In Barry's lab, the Flash told Wally about how he had gotten his powers - a stray bolt of lightning that hit a rack of chemicals, which in turn hit him.A bolt of lightning struck chemicals which spilled on Wally granted him super-speed powers similar to Barry's, the exact same way in which Barry received his powers. Wally would later find out that the Speed Force used these accidents as a cover to grant super-speed powers to both him and Barry.Barry revealed his dual identity to Wally, and a new partnership was forged. Wally became Flash's sidekick, Kid Flash. Initially, Wally wore a costume mirroring Barry's. As a strategic decision during a battle, Flash altered Wally's costume to a primarily-yellow design. After the battle, Wally chose to keep the costume, and wore it through his whole career as Kid Flash.</hero:origin>

    <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Deadpool goes to Washington D.C. for the cherry blossom festival, and becomes enraged when Titanium Man and his terrorists attack the city, and attacks the players. Once he is defeated he aids the heroes in rescuing Senator Stan Lieber from the armored super villain, and takes him back to safety while the Alliance continues after Titanium Man. His attacks are still based on guns, grenades and katanas, but his fighting system has been rebuilt from the ground up. Deadpool has unique dialogue with Black Widow and Cable, and his alternate costume is an unmasked variant of his Ultimate Universe costume. Deadpool is also aware that he is in the game, frequently mentioning the need for red orbs or whining about his low health bar, all while referring to you as "Player".</hero:mediaDescription>

So Deadpool accepted for the price of the continuity cube. Wilson tracked the Beyonder to a nightclub but liked the Beyonder's lifestyle and joined the party. While hanging with the Beyonder in a flying limo, Spider-Man came and asked for the Beyonder to remove the symbiote from his costume, but ended up getting shot by the limo driver. The Symbiote then left Parker's body and merged onto Wilson's making him Venompool.</hero:alternateVersions>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When Weapon X made a comeback, a newly upgraded Sabretooth was sent to bring Deadpool in as a new agent. Deadpool still had a grudge for all the torture, but the new administration pledged to him they were here to help. To prove it, they injected him with a serum that temporarily fixed his skin deformities. They required Wade to prove himself first. They made him accompany Garrison Kane to Iowa to track a powerful new mutant. Kane killed the child for being too risky, angering Wade.This got The Director to trust Wade, though. His next mission was to bring in his old girlfriend, Copycat. Wade was reluctant, but he knew if anyone else was sent, they would just kill her. He agreed to bring her in even though he planned on rescuing her. Unfortunately, Kane followed him and attacked as soon as he found Vanessa. The two of them got into a big fight after Wade got Vanessa to safety. Once Kane was defeated, Wade returned to Vanessa, only to find her dead with the words 'Sabretooth was here' written in her blood on the wall.Vengeful, Wade geared up to take the fight to Weapon X. He killed a number of the security goons, but when Weapon X fixed his scars, they also changed his healing factor. It began to destabilize causing him to liquify, leaving behind only a hand. With Deadpool dead, Weapon X mailed the hand to Wolverine with yet another invitation to join them.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:evolution rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Deadpool's debut marked a very different version of the character. He was a serious, grim, and professional assassin, with none of his personality trademarks intact. It would be in his solo book that his trademark character traits would finally emerge. These would include the dark randomness to his actions, his humorous bend, schizophrenic tendencies, his suicidal personal outlook, and his 4th wall breaking quips that would make him famous, along with his love for Mexican food. Recently, Deadpool has been trying to be a hero.Deadpool has been known for carrying a number of weapons and sometimes it is as if they appear from nowhere, this is often referred to as a 'magic satchel'. Blind Al is also a significant catalyst in Deadpool's personal development, as there is a clear love hate relationship which can vary from Blind Al being a mother-like figure to an abused hostage; sometimes within the same storyline.Starting with Daniel Way's run, to depict Deadpool's unstable sanity, creators started featuring POV shots of how cartoonish Deadpool saw the world and multiple narrative voices. He had at least three voices: Deadpool's insane inner monologue, a saner narrative voice of reason, and his own out loud voice. All three would argue with each other. Eventually, the extra narrative box would be ret-conned as rival Madcap through a flashback where both were destroyed, and Wade absorbed him during his healing process.As Deadpool's popularity increased, so did his prominence in the publishing line. In a meta twist, his popularity was included in-universe with Wade monetizing his own heroism. After earning the trust of both Wolverine and Captain America, he was recruited to X-men and Avengers adjacent teams. He started a friendship with Spider-Man and was often featured as a guest star across multiple books. After ruining his in-universe reputation during the Secret Empire event, Deadpool's appearances dropped drastically. Ever since, his on-goings have failed to catch on, but he has found a regular main character role in the Krakoa version of X-Force.</hero:evolution>
    <hero:creation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Created by artist Rob Liefeld and writer Fabian Nicieza, Deadpool made his first appearance in The New Mutants #98 (1991). Rob Liefeld has publicly stated that he had always loved the simplicity of Spider-Man's design, and therefore designed a character with a full-head mask. Deadpool was originally a parody of DC Comics' character Deathstroke, and there are real name similarities (Deathstroke’s real name is Slade Wilson) between the two. Wade's alias "Deadpool" was taken from the fifth Dirty Harry film The Dead Pool.Another inspiration was G.I. Joe's ninja Snake-Eyes.</hero:creation>

    <hero:origin rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Wade Wilson was born as a normal person into a highly dysfunctional family in a small town in the state of Ohio. He ran away as a teenager and bounced around the country, all the while getting military training from various sources until he decided to become a mercenary. He kept changing his identity whenever something went wrong with the mission. He moved to Canada where he met a man by the name of Wade T. Wilson. Since he was Wade W. Wilson, the name reminded him of his old self. When he was ordered to assassinate Wade T., he accidentally killed the target's wife, Mercedes. In the end, Wade T. ran away to eventually become the voodoo mercenary T-Ray while Wade W. kept the name "Wade T. Wilson" and never changed it out of respect for his namesake's wife. When he was diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer, he volunteered for a subset of the Weapon-X program that was attempting to imbue a normal human with Wolverine’s healing factor.Since he is Wade T. Wilson, he has Canadian citizenship, allowing him entry into the Weapon X program. The procedure was a success, but Deadpool, who took his name from the pool that the officers and scientists bet in as to who would die next in the experimentation, became severely mentally unbalanced as a result of it.

He just can't vibrate through solid objects without blowing them up. Depending on the Writer, he can manage it only if he focuses enough because it's not that he can't, his molecules are just charged with an immense power exceeding other speedsters, and it takes a lot of energy for him to control them. It's also impossible to cut him off from the Speed Force, as he was "chosen". Oh and yeah, he's considered to be the fastest of all the Flashes. Even in Rebirth, he stated that he has beaten Barry in a race before, and when Barry recalls it, this was when he was Kid Flash! Superman note Who is from the pre-Flashpoint timeline and knows Wally in his prime later tells him that he's currently even faster than he was before. Later still, he manages to outpace Barry again, and Word of God even stated that Wally is the fastest speedster in the DCU. In Flash Forward, the multiversal guardian Tempus Fuginaut says Wally is the fastest being in all of existence.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Wally's limits during his early tenure as the Flash are largely down to this. Firstly, he knew enough about science to know he should require a large fuel source, and thus was a Big Eater who was always hungry, and his powers wouldn't work when he hadn't eaten (evidently, he didn't know enough to not recognise he wasn't consuming nearly enough fuel to support his speed). Then he had a deep-seated fear of tarnishing Barry's memory by replacing him, and so kept himself at a lower speed to avoid being seen as a Superior Successor (until he was able to get over this fear and surpassed it). Now that he understands the Speed Force, he lacks many of these limits, though his powers are prone to waning depending on his mental state.</hero:tropeDescription>

She projects these mental images into the X-Men too, so it seems like individual members of the Hellfire Club are the ones fighting them and messing with their heads. Cassandra had planted a suggestion in her mind before being imprisoned in a cocoon, and simply took advantage of these doubts and fears.</hero:tropeDescription>

He is also married to Apollo and has an adopted daughter named Jenny Quantum. At the end of the DC Wide crossover Flashpoint, the mysterious figure known as Pandora explained to the Flash that the separate worlds of mainstream DC, Vertigo and Wildstorm would be folded into one, as only combined could they face the coming threat to Earth and the universe. In so doing Midnighter became a member of the regular DC continuity. Because of this most of his past seems to have been erased, Midnighter is first seen when Stormwatch members are trying to convince Apollo to join their team.</hero:evolution>

    <hero:origin rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">First origin: Midnighter was a member of an secret experimental academy team created by the insane former Stormwatch Weatherman, Henry Bendix. Bendix erased the team's memories when he gave them superpowers. Midnighter, alongside Apollo, Lamplight, Crow Jane, Amaze, Impetus, and Stalker, formed the ill-fated team that would be sent to their deaths by Henry Bendix on their first mission. When Midnighter and Apollo sought extraction during this mission, it was only to discover that Bendix has no intention of wasting time or resources to save them when he could so easily replace them with more "super-soldiers."Betrayed, Apollo and Midnighter managed to escape with their lives, but would spend the next six years in hiding on the streets, attempting to remain invisible to the Weatherman's ever-watchful eye from the Stormwatch headquarters orbiting the earth. During this time, both team members fought to better the world on a smaller scale, and came together as lovers. Because of their self imposed exile, both Midnighter and Apollo were ignorant of Stormwatch's battle against Henry Bendix, and of his supposed death at the hands of Jenny Sparks. Only when Jackson King, the new Weatherman, discovered them on radar and brought them in for questioning (ultimately testing their loyalties by sending them on a mission) did the pair realize they were free to live in the open again as normal human beings. All files related to whom both Midnighter and Apollo were before their introduction into the team were believed to be lost, and since neither man could remember, Jackson King instead gave them new identities with which to retire from the super-soldier business.</hero:origin>
    <hero:origin rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Post Flashpoint Origin: Midnighter was once a boy from Kosovo who was abducted by owl shaped aliens when coming back from working in a neighbor's farm when he was a child. His life ended that night, what he is today grew from that wreckage of an existence. He was experimented upon for many years before he finally escaped. It was during his escape, in which the air dent he was in fell apart that he first met Apollo.</hero:origin>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> For a long time he considered Barry to be better than himself, to a degree that he mentally limited himself to the speed of sound for a while. It took him a lot of Character Development to consider himself as equal to him (or even surpass him). Addressed again in Speed Metal with a case of Leaning on the Fourth Wall mixed in. note Publisher Dan Didio has an admitted dislike/burning hatred of Wally West, Dick Grayson and legacy in general. Throughout his run he either actively tried to replace Wally or put his character through hell. Infamously he erased Wally for the New 52. And despite his return in Rebirth, derailed many of the plans Johns and the writers had for the character. Dan Jurgens had planned to reunite Wally with his family but was banned, attempts to start Wally-focused books were torpedoed and most infamously he insisted Wally be the one to suffer the most in Heroes in Crisis. All of this comes from the simple fact Didio liked Barry better.. Wally accomplished huge feats on his own and with others, things that Barry simply never had. Yet, upon Barry's return Wally found himself pushed back into the role of "second" by many. Barry never intended that but Wally was overshadowed regardless. As Barry notes it was made worse since Flashpoint happened not long after Barry came back and Wally primarily remembers a life Barry is still missing many pieces of, they haven't had a lot of opportunities to bond as equals. Speed Metal then ends with Barry stepping aside as a leader because Wally doesn't need to be in anyone's shadow. Ironically, Wally himself was very much this to Bart and Jesse, who separately struggled with being unable to keep up with him. Bart's early tenure as the Flash when Wally disappeared had him often angsting about living up to his example in a similar manner Wally could sometimes be like towards Barry's, and Jesse quietly resented being unable to catch up to him.</hero:tropeDescription>

And if you hurt a kid with mental issues (especially one you have authority over), he goes completely serious and will kill you pro bono. And there won't be a joke, not even a peep, from either of the other comedic "voices" in his head.

With Green Arrow (Oliver Queen) acting as her backup, Cassandra secretly delivered annual reports to Batman on the team's progress.Sticking rigidly to her sense of responsibility and, under her disguise, redemption, Kasumi's self discipline attracted the attention of Coldcast (Nathan Jones) as a brotherly influence for her on the team as it began to fall apart. When Coldcast was accused of murdering a captured dictator in cold blood, Cassandra insisted on his innocence and, after the team was disbanded due to Manchester Black's return, Cassandra infiltrated Coldcast's prison to break him out and face Black before he destroyed the planet.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma sides with the X-Men where she tried to take Hope deeper into Utopia away from the Avengers and the battle. She was close to telepathically shutting down the Avenger's mental defenses when Iron Man shows up using a nanotech taser cloud to block her telepathy. Emma is forced into her diamond form and after a brief battle with Iron Man is defeated shortly after until Magneto shows up to battle Iron Man, saving her. After the Avengers have soundly won the Battle of Utopia and Hope has run off, Cyclops surrenders the X-Men. The Avengers become aware that this is just a ruse, as Cyclops has Magik teleport the X-Men away. Emma is with Scott when he visits the Jean Grey School to ask for recruits and sanctuary. A brief battle with Wolverine's X-Men ensues, and the Extinction Team leaves the premises. They find out Hope is heading to the moon. Emma, and four other mutants, Cyclops, Magik, Colossus, and Namor, acquire a share of the Phoenix thanks to Iron Man using a new armor to stop it from bonding with Hope. Emma and the rest of the Phoenix Five take Hope back to Earth in order to prepare for future events. They announce they will cleanse the Earth.Emma and the rest of the Phoenix Five fix the Earth by ending hunger, providing an unlimited source of free, clean energy and water, and also outlaw war 'Pax Utopia'. In order to outlaw war, they destroy all large weapons including sentinels, missiles, submarines, tanks, etc. Emma destroyed sentinels from all around the world. In order to complete this job, she arrived at Avengers Academy to destroy the sentinel belonging to Juston. Despite its being a killing machine, Justin has grown attached to the sentinel and refuses to let Emma destroy it. The students of the Academy step in to prevent Emma from taking the sentinel apart. Hank Pym joins the fray, and together they make a stand against Emma, who easily tosses them around with her new powers. She cannot understand why the students would want to protect a mutant-hunting robot. She is most surprised by X-23 who attacks Emma to defend her friend. Laura is a mutant and Emma believed that she would side with her. Emma was able to thwart Laura's attack by shifting into diamond form. Emma offered to simply wipe the processing unit of the sentinel so that its prime directive to "Destroy all mutants!" would be erased. Juston wouldn't allow this claiming that it would do away with the sentinel's personality. Having been unable to reach a compromise, Emma decided to simply destroy the machine. Rather than melting it, however, she took it apart, so that Justin could rebuild it with a new unit. She melted its core so that it could not be used again. After extending an invitation to X-23 (that was hastily rejected), Emma took her leave of the school. Unbeknownst to her, Quicksilver had switched out the sentinel's unit with his super speed so that the sentinel would be safe after all. Emma's battle at Avengers Academy led to Hank Pym's announcement that the school would be closed because it was unsafe.Later, Emma and Namor talk about Transonic being imprisoned. Namor is disgusted with it and Emma tells him she knows where the girl is. In what appears to be a manipulative moment for Emma, most likely due to the corruption and the power of the part of the Phoenix Force in her, kisses Namor and tells him Transonic is in Wakanda and that she, Emma, hasn't told Scott about her whereabouts.Another scuffle with the Avengers occurs when the Avengers invade a remodeled Utopia (which now ascends all the way into the sky with all new levels of paradise) to snatch away Hope Summers. Emma and Scott prepare to battle the Avengers and permanently end the conflict, but the Scarlet Witch intervenes and teleports a voluntary Hope and the Avengers away. Emma talks with Cyclops who goes on to say that despite all the good X-Men do and all the good they have done, mankind still hates and fears them. That they will always be pushed further into a corner and steal away their innocent despite being endangered so few. The humans will always send their "heroes" to attack the mutants and continue to push them around. She watches as Cyclops simply states "No more Avengers." He plans to take the Avengers off the board, permanently.With Magneto bringing Namor's actions to Scott's attention, he questions Emma. Emma tells him Namor is his own man and that Scott has no authority over him. Emma tells him to look at the benefit of what happened with the Avengers being found. Emma and the rest of the Phoenix Five go to Wakanda wherein Namor's defeat, they absorb his share of the Phoenix Force. Emma calls for a meeting with Scott in the remote location of the Danakil Desert in Ethiopia. Emma and he talk and she go on to say she has reached into every mind on Earth. Scott tells her that she needs to stop sounding like Namor and that this isn't a war and she needs to come home. Emma tells Scott that Hope is in K'un Lun. Scott rushes off to retrieve Hope leaving Emma in mid-sentence begging for him to stop her as she is scared of what she might do next as the Phoenix Force's influence corrupts her further. She ends up making a man who had a hit and runs accident with a thirteen-year-old mutant boy years ago and never reported it just because he was a mutant, brain dead. When Colossus and Magik fight, they manage to knock each other out in an attempt to gain the other's portion of the Phoenix Force. They are returned to their normal forms as their portions of the Phoenix Force leave them and presumably go to Emma and Scott.Emma is now almost completely corrupted by the Phoenix Force. She has forced all the remaining X-Men to bow down and worship her. Only one resisted and that was Magneto. Emma explains that she is indeed the more powerful of the two which spites Magneto to contact Xavier saying both Emma and Scott are completely gone. Scott is in need of more power after his defeat at the hands of Hope taking the power of Iron Fist and Scarlet witch so he is heading after Emma.Emma talks with Scott telling him she can read his thoughts about how he thinks he might take her half. Emma begins to go on on a rant threatening to burn the world but Cyclops yells at her to stop talking like that and asks what has gotten into her. She replies with a worried look that she doesn't know. The Avengers and X-Men attack the two remaining avatars and they fight back. As the fight continues on the outside, Emma and Cyclops have a psychic dinner discussing things. Emma reveals to Scott even more disturbing tendencies such as using human blood as a sauce for a steak. She tells him about the psychic affair and that she truly loves him. She continues to talk about destroying the world and that she will be a queen of ash and they will just rebuild anew. Emma's corruption is almost complete and Cyclops realizes this. He asks for her forgiveness as Emma is stricken down by him and her half of the force is absorbed. Emma is arrested by the Avengers who are then attacked by Purifier being labeled as mutant sympathizers. The Avengers defeat them and then Emma is escorted to prison and the Extinction team is revealed to still be active.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma Frost became the White Queen after meeting Sebastian Shaw, who became her patron and her lover. He recognized her power as an extremely high-level telepath and thought it best to recruit her.Emma first encounters the X-men while she is the 'White Queen' of the dangerous Hellfire Club. She tries to forcibly recruit Kitty Pryde to the club but was opposed by the X-Men. Though Emma is initially triumphant, the X-Men eventually defeats her. She and her mutant students, the Hellions would encounter the X-Men many times after this.Emma also plotted with Sebastian Shaw to kill Selene during her time as White Queen, as Sebastian Shaw saw Selene as a threat to his power. Emma was in charge of training a young mutant with great power named Firestar, who was meant to kill Selene, but Firestar inevitably found out about Emma and Shaw's true intentions and turned on them.At some point, Emma decided that she wanted more students, and approached Erik Magnus aka Magneto to get him to transfer his students to her academy. The White Queen snuck into Magneto's office and surprised him while he was pouring himself a drink. Magneto questions her, asking her why she had come to see him, and she tells him that her intentions are not hostile, as if they were he would be dead. Magneto tells her that he will never transfer his students, so Emma used her telepathy to influence Magneto and force him to do so.Her time with the Hellfire Club ends when she is attacked by a mad time traveler named Trevor Fitzroy. In the ensuing incident which also involved the X-Men, most of the Hellions are killed, and Emma in sent into a coma. She is eventually revived, although her mind is transferred to Bobby Drake's body. Initially, Emma thought Xavier is holding her hostage, so she flees to Frost International - still in Iceman's body. Accessing one of her computers, Emma discovers her Hellions were dead and blames herself for it.When Xavier and some other X-Men finally catch up with her, Frost confesses to Charles that the only reason she fights him over young mutants was that she believes that she could offer them something Xavier can't and that their deaths prove that she was wrong. Emma then agrees to go back to the X-Mansion and have her mind transferred back to her body.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A solo movie starring Ryan Reynolds had been in development for years, though due to the negative reception to X-Men Origins: Wolverine, it was not related to that movie and was closer to the comics. A script was written as far back as 2010, and test footage for the movie was leaked in 2014. On September 18, 2014, Fox announced that the movie was officially in the works for a February 2016 release date.The movie additionally starred Ed Skrein as Ajax, Morena Baccarin as Vanessa, T.J. Miller as Weasel, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, Stefan Kapicic as the voice of Colossus, Gina Carano as Angel Dust and Brianna Hildebrand as newcomer to the big-screen, Negasonic Teenage Warhead. The film was directed by Tim Miller from a script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.The plot consisted mostly of a Deadpool origin story. After being diagnosed with very aggressive cancer, lovestruck mercenary, Wade Wilson, allows a clandestine criminal thinktank to do experiments on him with the promise of curing his cancer. Instead, they torture his X-gene into activating, which gives him a superhuman healing factor that is constantly working against the fast spreading cancer, causing his body and his mind to be unstable. Afraid of what his fianc' will say about his new appearance, Wade crafts the Deadpool identity to hunt down the people who took advantage of him.The film opened to positive reviews and was a massive hit at the box office.</hero:mediaDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">During a fight with the Black Flash, who had apparently claimed the life of Linda, Wally saved her from the Speed Force. He proposed to her and they were almost married shortly thereafter, but she then disappeared off the face of the Earth, and no one, not even Wally, remembered her.Wally then got caught up in an adventure spanning through different eras. Malcolm Thawne, Barry Allen's twin brother, reappeared, beginning the Allen-Thawne feud. Barry's death during the Crisis on Infinite Earths appeared to have cheated Malcolm out of his dreams of revenge on his brother. Instead, Malcolm focused on Allen's descendants traveling through time in a bid to exterminate them, starting with Wally West. Under the identity of Cobalt Blue, Malcolm ignited a family feud that endured for a millennium.The feud came to a head in the late 30th Century, where Barry Allen was living with his wife Iris. Wally West arrived to try and protect his uncle. Flashes of all eras between the 20th and 30th centuries arrived soon after, all under the control of Thawne's spirit because they all were carrying a shard of the original Cobalt Blue gem. In the end, Wally West ended the menace of Cobalt Blue by running so fast that he skirted the edge of the Speed Force. Its power poured into the gem, and Thawne's spirit (and the gem itself) overloaded from the excess energy. Wally then vanished into the Speed Force. At that same moment, a new, mysterious Flash appeared in Keystone City.Linda's disappearance was caused by a mysterious man who had a deep hatred for the Flash; he abducted her and kept her imprisoned within Limbo. This was also the reason behind why everyone on Earth had forgotten about her--Linda was taken from a time prior to her originally meeting Wally. Linda escaped from his prison and landed in an alternate Keystone City, where she encountered who she thought was Wally, until she noticed three distinct things: Keystone City's police were after Wally and called him "Walter"; Wally seemed to be mentally unbalanced; and this Wally's eyes were blue, not green. Linda next encountered this world's Pied Piper, who told her to run from Wally because he was dangerous.Linda ran toward the Flash Museum, where she found a memorial statue dedicated to her dimensional counterpart, who sacrificed her life to save Keystone City from the villain Kobra. After again encountering Walter at a cemetery, Wally, following his link to Linda, emerged from the Speed Force. A battle ensued between Wally and Walter, where they were evenly matched. However, Walter came back with a vengeance, pinning Wally to a wall with a vibrationally-charged rebar. Wally tried to explain to Walter that he and Linda were from a parallel world; he also explained that although they share the same memories, Wally could never turn into the man Walter has become. That statement set off Walter's anger once again, starting another fight with Wally.Walter then let loose with the fact that after his Linda's death, he sought out Savitar, and after tricking him into teaching Walter every trick and skill he knew, killed him. After Walter's revelation, Abra Kadabra appeared, trapping both Wally and Walter. Kadabra explained that he tried to break the bond that draws Wally back to this dimension by casting a spell to make everyone forget that Linda existed and hold her outside of time, but she escaped, landing in that alternate Keystone and drew Wally to her once again. To defeat Kadabra, Wally temporarily merged his physical essence with Walter's, gaining greater speed and learning a few new skills; from this merging, Walter also finally came to terms with not being able to save his Linda from death.Kadabra, however, faked his defeat at their hands and seemingly discorporated Wally and Linda's essences; in actuality, they ended up traversing through countless alternate dimensions, nearly losing their minds until they found their home dimension, thanks to Bart (he was actually born outside of time, rendering him immune to chronal alterations). Wally and Linda finally made it back to their Keystone City; however, Linda was still forgotten from everyone's minds. Wally then sought out Jay Garrick, told him of his plans to rescue Linda, and set off for the Flash Museum, where he donned a Reverse-Flash costume and "allied" himself with Abra Kadabra and Replicant. Wally then kidnapped Jay Garrick, Bart Allen, and Jesse Quick and took them to Kadabra's abandoned theater hideout, where as Professor Zoom, he taunted Kadabra into reversing the spell he cast on Linda, bringing her back in full, to everyone's memory; Professor Zoom then pulled back his cowl, revealing himself as none other than Wally West. The final battle between Wally, Walter, and Abra Kadabra ensued. Kadabra preparing a spell to wipe the memories of the Flash legacy from the world's minds forever. On Linda's suggestion, Wally, Walter, Jay, Max, and Bart used mirrors to block and reflect Kadabra's spell back at him, rendering Kadabra himself with amnesia. A short while later, Linda gave birth to twins, Jai and Iris.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Parodied (?) with Deadpool as there have been a number of comics and mini-series that place him in various eras of the Marvel Universe that predate his creation— teaming up with Iron Fist and Luke Cage during their "Heroes for Hire" era, taking over for Iron Man during the "Demon in a Bottle" era, even showing up in the original Secret Wars and bonding with the Venom symbiote. However, it's quite hard to tell which of these stories (if any) have actually happened and which ones are simply What Ifs created in the spirit of fun (particularly when you remember that it's already been established that 1) Deadpool's mental instability has been known to mess with his memory and 2) he's aware that he's a comic book character, thus subject to Multiple-Choice Past).</hero:tropeDescription>

Frost has been cited as a "World-class telepath", "Omega Class Telepath" and a "Psi of the Highest Order" capable of extraordinary telepathic feats. When Wolverine thought to be protected from her thanks to Level 9 Psi-Shields created by Charles Xavier, she stated she was herself Level 10. More specifically, since her introduction, Emma has displayed the telepathic standards of broadcasting and receiving thoughts, mind-control, altering perceptions and memories, projection of offensive blasts of psionic energy causing mental pain or unconsciousness, Astral Projection, mind switching, brain engram modification, mental sedation of unconscious victims, induction of mental pain by touch and limited psychometry...in short, every form of Mind Rape. However she can't use them when in her Nigh Invulnerable mode.</hero:tropeDescription>

When Deadpool actually died, he got together with Death herself. Her on-and-off boyfriend Thanos angrily brought him back to life and made him immortal to separate them.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:alternateVersions rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma Frost of the Ultimate universe is a former student of Charles Xavier. Xavier and Frost became romantically involved while Xavier was still in a relationship with Mystique, causing Mystique to angrily lash out at Xavier in a grotesque form until Emma had to diamond-punch her. Emma was even responsible for the naming of Xavier's cat, saying it should be named Mystique when it destroyed his office in a similar manner to the actual Mystique. Emma and Charles, however, didn't make it as a couple. Frost leaves Xavier for mostly ideological differences as she thinks his approach to the mutant/human relation was too violent. Frost is more passive towards working on the mutant/human relation then Xavier. Frost goes back to Chicago and becomes a teacher giving mutant education seminars. The governor is very supportive of Frost's idea and helped introduce her to the White House chief of staff and eventually met the President.They come up with the New Mutants which is supposed to help educate humans about mutants while cutting ties with Xavies. During a press conference, Emma, the New Mutants, and even the President are attacked by Sentinels. Xavier and the X-Men came to help them. Xavier tried to convince Emma to come back to the school but she declined and returned to Chicago. In Chicago, she creates a new program called Academy of Tomorrow (the X-Men-like squad of the school being the Ultimate version of the New Mutants). She was later shown to be dating Shinobi Shaw (son of the deceased leader of the club, Sebastian Shaw). After Shinobi is arrested for attacking Jean Grey in order to release the Phoenix Force she was revealed to be the White Queen of this universe's Hellfire Club (wearing an outfit highly similar to her mainstream counterpart's White Queen garb) and requesting a new boyfriend. During the Ultimatum event, she is later confirmed dead by Madrox in issue #3.This version of Emma dresses more modestly and professionally than her mainstream counterpart, with even her initial outfit similar to her mainstream counterpart's White Queen costume showing very little skin. It is only when she is revealed as the White Queen that she wears the more revealing attire recognizable by her alternate counterpart. She also wore glasses most of the time (including as the White Queen). She also displays only her diamond form and is not shown using telepathy, though she was silenced before mentioning other powers.</hero:alternateVersions>

First came the hockey-themed Puckman. Then, there was... Ms. Puckman. As of All-New, All-Different Marvel, there's now Gwenpool, who contrary to what the name implies has no direct connection to Deadpool or Gwen Stacy, and keeps explaining that her resemblance to a Composite Character of the two is just a huge coincidence.</hero:tropeDescription>

It also happens every time he's lost in the Speed Force. The first time, Max Mercury was adamant that nobody could return from the Speed Force, and Wally is the first to do so because of his love for Linda. The second time, he's able to connect to Linda despite her being removed from reality by Abra Kadabra. The third time, he and Linda disappeared and turned up on an alien planet, returning thanks to the Legion of Super-Heroes. DC Rebirth had him lost to the Speed Force thanks to Abra Kadabra once again, but in a meta-sense, he became the pre-Flashpoint Wally complete with his memories, and returned thanks to Barry. Speed Metal does this in a different way; after the Trauma Conga Line that he'd suffered the last decade, Wally retakes his position as the lead Flash, complete with returning him to his 90s suit, and has him reunited with the full Flash Family (who all happily rally behind him and follow his lead).</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Because so much of her fighting style is based around reading body language, she has a hard time fighting foes who aren't human and thus don't have human body language (She was geared to read human body language so trying to read someone or something that's not human would be like trying to understand Russian when you speak Mandarin), people who can keep up with her body language reading ability (like her mother Shiva who is the deadliest assassin in the world and also seems to have this ability), people who are physically augmented to be able to perfectly coordinate and control their movements so as not to give away their moves while "bluffing" very well (this would apply to low-level enhanced individuals like Deathstroke whose body language Cassandra noted as being like a chorus that's "too fast with too many instruments" to pick up anything significant), and of course those who specialize in Confusion Fu (people like the Joker fall into this category as the Joker was overwhelming her in a fight much to Black Canary's shock. Batman explained that she can read the Joker's body language but to her "It's just gibberish".) Also, because she's reading body language, she obviously relies heavily on her eyes. While Cassandra can fight blind folded and detect movement with her other senses, taking away her sight or being unable to see her opponent greatly hinders her effectiveness as it would be the same as putting heavy ear muffs (While some words may get through, the dialogue is terribly muffled and some words may be missed). Cassandra has a harder time predicting her opponents and may be caught off guard.</hero:tropeDescription>

When the Midnighter tried returning to his hometown and his old identity, he ended up battling paramilitary superhumans who wanted to take over America. But he also became certain he never had been Lucas Trent, because Trent was remembered by everyone as a nice and decent man and the Midnighter knew himself to be a gleeful killer through and through. To Jenny's surprise, however, he wasn't angry with her for the deception; instead, he returned to Harmony to impersonate Trent further and practice being a normal person in a normal daily life. He also recently teamed up with the hero Grifter.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Wally West appears as Kid Flash in the series, voiced by Jason Spisak.He is initially introduced acting as the partner to The Flash, when at the age of 15, he was invited to join the Justice League. He joined Aqualad, Robin, and Speedy on July 4 in entering the Hall of Justice after having defeated Captain Cold with Flash. While the League was dealing with other matters, Aqualad, Kid Flash, and Robin investigated a fire at Cadmus Labs. Together they rescued a clone of Superman, known as the Super Boy, and with his assistance, defeated a mutated Mark Desmond. In an act of defiance, the four teens banded together to form a team, and on July 8 they were brought to the Secret Sanctuary, where they met their fifth member, Miss Martian.When the team was confronted by Mister Twister, Miss Martian posed as Red Tornado using Kid Flash to generate twisters. When she crushed the android within the battle suit, Kid Flash took the inner android's eye as a souvenir, the beginning of a tradition. During the team's first official mission, Kid Flash questioned Robin's abilities as a leader. After some hesitation, he agreed with the team and accepted Aqualad as his leader.Later, Wally was introduced to the sixth member of the team, Artemis. The two, however, did not get along, not even on missions. The rift between them was so that in the episode "Infiltrator", when Miss Martian and Artemis were caught off guard by while protecting Dr. Roquette from the League of Shadows, Wally placed all blame on Artemis even though both women were equally at fault.Friction between Artemis and Kid Flash increased during the team's next mission when they went to rescue Kent Nelson from Abra Kadabra and Klarion the Witch Boy. Frustrated with the way Kid Flash became careless in his pursuit of Miss Martian, she outed him as a non-believer of magic. Later, in a moment of friendship, she asked him how he was handling the team's latest adventure, and immediately became frustrated again when Wally explained away the magic he had just witnessed. Unbeknownst to her, Nelson suggested that Wally pursue Artemis; advice he promptly disregarded.Batman contacted the Team with a new mission: tracking Clayface in the Gotham City sewers. Kid Flash proposed waiting for Artemis to arrive, but Batman required their help right away.In the sewers, the Team did not find Clayface'he found them. The monster attacked, and pressed Kid Flash against the side of the pipe. Clayface got away.The Team regrouped in the Bio-Ship. Kid Flash changed into a new costume. They discussed strategy, and Robin suggested splitting up. Aqualad, lost in thought, agreed.Clayface hunted down the entire Team, one by one. He impersonated Miss Martian to catch Kid Flash off guard.The Team was defeated, only Aqualad was still standing, but barely. Batman intervened and soundly defeated Clayface.Back at the cave, Batman ordered the team to head home, except Aqualad.The Allens, the Wests and the Garricks celebrated Jay Garrick's birthday at the West family home. September 2010: Batman sent the Team on a recon mission into energy surges in the Bialyan desert, but the mission went horribly wrong after Psimon found them. He blocked the memories of everyone in the Team for the last six months. Stumbling off into the desert, Kid Flash awoke to find Artemis unconscious, so he pulled her into a shack to get her out of the heatWaking up Artemis, their conversation was cut short when the two were forced out of the hut they were in after hearing a bomb being dropped. Together, the two had to continuously flee from the pursuing Bialyan troops.Kid Flash and Artemis eventually met up with Miss Martian and Robin. In order to find out what caused their memory loss, Miss Martian dug into the collective memory of the group. They discovered their leader was missing. They soon found Aqualad, severely dehydrated in the desert. Kid Flash, Artemis, and Robin were forced to take care of him themselves while heading for the bio-ship after Miss Martian left them to rescue Superboy, despite their objections.Kid Flash, Robin, and Artemis all made it to the bio-ship with Aqualad. There, they treated him until Miss martian returned with Superboy and the newly acquired Sphere.After the ordeal in Bialya, Artemis, Kid Flash and Robin took the Zeta-tube home.Kid Flash appeared in time to interrupted the private session of Superboy and Miss Martian to help them fix their motorcycle. Aqualad later appeared to ask them how they were handling their duties to the team whilst juggling school time. Unbeknownst to Kid Flash and the others, while they were talking, Red Torpedo and Red Inferno infiltrated the cave and overwhelmed the unknowing teammates with a large body of water and fire, and imprisoned them.Kid Flash and the others were eventually freed when Robin and Artemis created an EMP to knock out Inferno and Torpedo, negating their powers. When Red Tornado returned to investigate, he feigned reprogramming and sucked the air out of the room, knocking Kid Flash and the others unconscious. Kid Flash awoke later when the League came to check on them.A day after the cave was attacked, Kid Flash was livid and demanded answers. Upon learning from Superboy'who listened on the conversation between Aqualad and Batman'that Aqualad withheld knowledge of a mole, he and the other teammates instantly grew angry and antagonistic to Aqualad for keeping secrets from the team. Before the situation got out of hand, Batman assigned the team a mission.As they landed in Northern India, the team continued with the animosity to Aqualad. Kid Flash and Robin headed off by themselves without listening to Aqualad's plans. While investigating, the duo was attacked by large vultures, which were surmised were under the influence of Kobra Venom. After dealing with the vultures, they were contacted telepathically by Aqualad. This did not sit well with them, for they again displayed antagonism towards him. It was not until Aqualad established his role as the leader while promising to put it up for discussion after the mission was over did they quiet down and listen to him.Kid Flash and the others regrouped at the hideout where Captain Marvel was held captive. After shutting down the invisible field around the dome and dealing with the opposition that followed, Kid Flash and the others made it inside. There, they met the Brain. After a period of fighting, they eventually forced The Brain to retreat with Monsieur Mallah. Kid Flash kept Monsieur Mallah's beret as a souvenir.Before heading off, Robin questioned Aqualad for withholding knowledge of a mole. He responded that the source of the mole was Sportsmaster, who could not be fully trusted. After giving his reason, the team voted to keep Aqualad as their leader. October 2010: In light of the plant attacks on Metropolis, Gotham City, Star City, Paris and Taipei by the Injustice League, Batman assigned the Team a mission to destroy the central control system.Moments after reaching the Injustice League's hideout, the Team's bio-ship was attacked by Count Vertigo and Black Adam, forcing them to leave it behind. Robin and Miss Martian headed off to destroy the central control system. Kid Flash and the others were left to deal with the Injustice League members, but were easily overwhelmed and knocked unconscious; they were then carried off to the headquarters by Wotan.They were eventually freed after Wotan was struck by the newly recovered bio-ship. As they landed on the ground, they were forced to face the Injustice League. While they put up a good fight, the team was soon overwhelmed after Wotan recovered from being hit by the bio-ship and attacked the team. This forced Aqualad to put on the Helmet of Fate, much to the disapproval of Kid Flash who, during that moment, was struck by Black Adam, sending him flying to a tree and breaking an arm. Even with Dr. Fate on their side, the team was still being beaten. The Justice League arrived just in time to quell the battle, forcing the Injustice League to surrender.Much to Kid Flash's surprise, Aqualad removed the helmet, giving thanks to Nelson for persuading Nabu. With everything over, Batman congratulated the team for a satisfactory performance.After being introduced to Zatanna, the team took it upon themselves to search for Red Tornado after being fed up with being left out on the search, despite being ordered otherwise. The Team took Zatanna along with them under the auspices of giving her a tour of Happy Harbor. While on the bio-ship, the team turned to Kid Flash to formulate an idea of where to head to first.Kid Flash's idea led the Team to visit Professor Ivo in Belle Reve, under the pardon of Hugo Strange. Upon questioning him, Ivo tacitly admitted he had knowledge of T.O. Morrow's whereabouts. Zatanna used her magic to force him to blurt out his exact location.After reaching Teton County, the Team was immediately confronted by Red Tornado, who blew words into the ground telling them to play dead. This prompted the arrival of Red Volcano, who was cognizant of the charade. Red Tornado left, leaving the Team to face Red Volcano. With his superior processing speed and memories of Red Tornado, Red Volcano easily handled the Team. Red Inferno, Red Torpedo, and Red Tornado soon arrived at the scene and helped defeat Red Volcano at the cost of their "lives", though Red Tornado was saved.Kid Flash then informed Red Tornado on what to do to counteract the effects of the erupted super volcano. With that over, they repaired him back at Morrow's lab.The Team took part in a psychic training exercise meant to simulate an alien attack on Earth, which was designed to grow worse the more the team accomplished. However, Miss Martian's telepathic powers caused things to spiral out of control after Artemis "died", which led everyone into believing everything was real. Kid Flash was livid over the death of Artemis and made it a goal to get revenge on the aliens. He later "died" alongside Robin during their final stand in an alien mother-ship, placing him in a coma. Martian Manhunter ended the simulation by "killing" Miss Martian, allowing everyone to awake. The team awoke immediately after Miss Martian was killed in the simulation. Everyone was visibly distraught over what occurred.Wally had a therapy session with Black Canary. Wally admitted being unaffected by how the simulation turned out, though he lost his cool upon being reminded how he reacted after the death of Artemis. Upon attempting to change the subject to Black Canary herself, she instead told him he was in denial, to which he did not deny.Wally was invited to a Halloween party by Megan and Conner. He decided to dress up as a werewolf. At the dance, Conner noticed that Marvin was playing a prank on the others by creating the impression of a Martian invasion. With the help of Wally and Megan, they made it look like the town was being invaded by Martians to get Marvin to confess to the prank. November 2010: Wally eagerly awaited M'gann's shopping trip, and was glad she picked him snicker doodles. While they unloaded, all of a sudden, the adults disappeared.The Team set up base of operations in the Cave, and a shelter in the high school. They discovered all adults in the world were missing, so it was up to them to keep the order.Kid Flash, Robin and Aqualad hosted a worldwide broadcast, in which they called on older children to take care of the younger, and act responsibly, while they looked for a solution.Since the source of the disappearance was magic, Aqualad and Kid flash briefly discussed using the Helmet of Fate, but decided not to. Zatanna found the epicenter of the magic: Roanoke Island. Billy Batson arrived in the Cave out of nowhere, and they discovered there were two dimensions, one for adults, and one for children. Through him, they were able to get messages across to Batman to form a coordinated attack.The Team attacked the culprit, Klarion, on a pentagram. Kid Flash remembered how he, with Doctor Fate, had defeated him last time, but Klarion anticipated an attack on Teekl. He deflected all their attacks; Zatanna had to don the Helmet of Fate to get his forcefield down. Kid Flash rushed towards the gem in the center of the pentagram and grabbed it. Doctor Fate, and Zatara in the adult world, merged the gem and the dimensions back together.Klarion escaped, and Zatara had to give up his own body to make Fate release his daughter. Since the Helmet was gone from his souvenir shelf, Wally replaced it with a sippy cup he got from a small child.Wally woke up on his birthday, elated as could be. He finally got his cast off, and during breakfast, he also learned his high school declared a snow day.He had dropped hints about his oncoming birthday for weeks, in the hopes of getting a surprise party. They gave him one, because as always, he hadn't been very subtle about it, and they didn't want to disappoint him. Wally had one birthday wish, a kiss from M'gann. He pestered her for one, and she eventually gave him one, on the forehead. His embarrassing behavior led Artemis to walk up behind him and inform him M'gann was off the market. Wally's party mood was ruined.The party was cut short by Batman, who had a mission for the Team. With the League short on members, the Team had to help them destroy five ice fortresses that were blanketing North America with snow. Kid Flash was excited, thinking this would be the perfect birthday gift. When Batman finished dividing up the teams, he was shocked to hear his name was not mentioned. That was because Batman had a different mission for him: the snow had grounded all air traffic, and a girl in Seattle needed a donor heart from Boston. He had to deliver it. He was annoyed at being left out, and only begrudgingly accepted.The local police had cleared a path to Boston General Hospital, but weren't fast enough on the freeways. Kid Flash had to jump over the gridlocked traffic. At the hospital, he attempted some small talk and flirting with Mattie Harcourt, but the resident just gave him the backpack, instructions and a timetable, and ordered him to get going. He had four hours to get to Seattle. He had reached the outskirts of Chicago within eighty minutes, but again found the traffic gridlocked. He made a detour, and the street full of fast food restaurants he picked made him hungry. He did not stop for a snack. As he progressed into South Dakota, he witnessed Vandal Savage attacking state troopers. He went back and attacked him, and after fifteen minutes, decided he had bigger things to worry about. He continued towards Seattle. With one hour and eighteen minutes remaining, he raced through the Mountain States. Unfortunately, he had run out of food, and had to run the last part on an empty stomach. He got to the hospital, and handed the heart to the nearest doctor. The doctor told him the girl was dead, it was too late. Devastated, Kid Flash sat down in the lobby. He was approached by another doctor, Pieter Cross, who told him the girl was alive, and actually Queen Perdita of Vlatava. Kid Flash realized the first doctor had conned him, and was just in time to spot him heading for the garage. In the parking lot, he fought the henchmen, as well as their leader, Count Vertigo. Though he was pinned down for a moment, he managed to retrieve the heart and bring it back upstairs. He collapsed in the lobby.When he came to, Perdita had been successfully operated, and was recovering. In order to fool Vertigo, they hatched a plot that involved declaring her dead. They hoped he would gloat his way into a confession.Count Vertigo fell for it: when Kid Flash "woke" in the hospital bed, the count informed him that he was now king, and since Perdita died on the operating table, he needn't have worried on his coup. Kid Flash revealed Perdita was listening (and recording) behind a curtain; Vertigo was arrested and stripped of his diplomatic immunity.Perdita offered Kid Flash Vertigo's sword, a family heirloom, as a souvenir.Wally decided not to go for the sword, but added the backpack he had carried to his collection instead. Dick congratulated him on saving an entire country, and Wally was glad he could help.Batman briefed the Team on their newest mission: Rumaan Harjavti, the democratically-elected president of Qurac, had uncharacteristically allied himself with Queen Bee, the dictator of neighboring Bialya. In two days, Qurac would be absorbed by Bialya, leaving Queen Bee as the sole monarch of the unified country. Queen Bee had the ability to control men, but she has not left Bialya. The Team was tasked to investigate the situation. Since Aqualad was busy helping Aquaman, Batman appointed Robin as mission leader. Kid Flash wanted to congratulate his friend on the honor, but he did not feel like it.The Team arrived at the Quraci-Bialyan border, which was abuzz with activity. Bialyan tanks had begun to cross the border, and had caused the animals on a border wildlife sanctuary to stampede. Robin acquiesced to Miss Martian's plea to help two civilians in harm's way, but insisted on maintaining stealth to prevent an international incident.The Team forcibly diverted the Bialyan military around the sanctuary, and rescued the civilians from the stampede. The boy, Garfield Logan, was ecstatic at being rescued by the heroes he idolized. His mother Marie, was far less excited. She worried that their rescue would trigger a retaliatory response from the Bialyans. Miss Martian stayed behind to assist Marie in rebuilding the fences, while the rest of the Team took Garfield and an injured oryx to the clinic.The Team was unwinding at the main compound when it came under attack from Bialyan drones. The planes were destroyed by Miss Martian, but Garfield was caught in an explosion. In shock, he needed a transfusion of the rare O-negative blood type, which none of the Team have. Kid Flash offered to run him to a hospital, but it was too far away. Miss Martian volunteered to molecularly shape-shift her blood cells to save his life.While the transfusion was ongoing, the downcast Team left Garfield's room to avoid distraction to the operation. Hoping to catch the news, Kid Flash accidentally played a videotape showing the opening sequence of Hello, Megan!, discovering precisely where Miss Martian had taken her human name, form, and mannerisms from, and why "Conner" was her favorite name.When Miss Martian joined them, Kid Flash quickly changed channels'the news showed the president at a conference. Superboy noticed Psimon directly behind him. Concluding that he was being mind-controlled, the Team resolved to free Harjavti.The Team infiltrated the presidential palace, only to find a subdued Harjavti asking for Psimon and his daughter. They were accosted by Bialyan soldiers bearing Apokoliptan weapons. The soldiers planned to kill Harjavti, and pin the blame on the Team. Robin ordered the Team to form around Harjavti to protect him, but Miss Martian had already left to look for Psimon.After taking out the soldiers, Kid Flash and the rest of the Team tried to locate Miss Martian. When they had reached her proximity, they were taken out by a psychic attack. When they regained consciousness, Psimon was already defeated. Miss Martian blamed Psimon for blasting their brains. Queen Bee was defeated by publicly defaming her'or actually, Miss Martian pretending to be her'in front of the cameras.Back at the Logan Animal Sanctuary, Garfield had recovered from his ordeal. Kid Flash confronted Miss Martian with the Hello, Megan! videotape. She explained that the show helped her past a difficult childhood on Mars. On Robin's request, she showed them her "true" Martian form, but lied again: she showed a bald version of herself, with facial features resembling Martian Manhunter's.Wally helped himself to some treats while M'gann and Zatanna prepared Thanksgiving dinner. He left after M'gann asked him if he should be heading home, since he would be celebrating the holiday with his family. December 2010: Wally was elated that Red Arrow finally joined the Team, but surprised at Artemis's reaction. Green Arrow gave them a mission to follow Sportsmaster, for which Artemis volunteered. On the way to New Orleans, Wally told Artemis he considered her part of the Team; he was just happy for Red Arrow because they go way back. But Artemis had, in his eyes, already proven herself.They found Sportsmaster easy enough. He had rented a boat, so they followed him. Wally rode his bike along the river. When he finally arrived at the location, he saw Roy and Artemis were fighting with Cheshire; he cannonballed into her and stole her sai. Red Arrow went after Sportsmaster, while Wally and Artemis had to fend off Cheshire. They allowed her to escape, after Artemis planted a tracer on her.They reviewed their case; Kid Flash defended Artemis from blame that she should have stayed in the Bio-Ship. He trusted her to track Cheshire, but she gave him the assignment instead.He followed it with Aqualad, but found it on a train, not on Cheshire. Red Arrow contacted them to meet him in New Orleans; Kaldur sent Kid Flash ahead.When he got to Red Arrow's location, Kid Flash attacked Cheshire, allowing Artemis the opportunity to investigate what went on in the back of the building. In the middle of the fight, Cheshire suddenly turned to ice and disappeared. All the other villains were gone.They returned home, where Red Arrow was quick to blame Artemis for the failure. She defended herself, but he didn't buy it. Kid Flash spoke in her defense as well, but then, Red Arrow showed him her tracer: she had deliberately shot a tracer at a passing train to send them in the wrong direction. Kid Flash accused her of insecurity, thinking Red Arrow's place in the Team caused her to want to solve the case solo. She didn't give a satisfying answer, which clinched it for him. He threw the sai at her feet, and added the tracer to his collection instead.Wally was hanging at the Cave, but everyone was gone. He checked with Red Tornado, but Batman hadn't given any missions. He contacted Dick, and confronted him with his finds. Robin had lied to the others about a secret mission from Batman, but confided with Wally that it was about Haly's Circus. Knowing his backstory, Wally thought he could have been a great addition to the mission. But Dick wouldn't have it; he didn't like his judgment being called into question. Wally replied that that was what best friends were for.The Team watched the induction of five new Justice Leaguers, including Red Arrow. They had to explain a lot to their newest member, Rocket, who was unfamiliar with everything that had happened the past weeks. In the middle of his explanation, Robin was interrupted by his computer. Cheshire was sighted boarding a plane in Asheville.They traced the plane to the Smokeys, and found it crashed in a valley. When they investigated, Riddler revealed it was an ambush; he put up a force field around them to prevent escape, and sent his associates in. Zatanna created a snowstorm, and each picked their target. Kid Flash took out multiple henchmen by running into them. When the battle was over, Riddler, Mammoth and Shimmer were arrested. They recovered a case Cheshire was carrying.The Team brought the case to Batman, who was going to.... But as soon as he and the other Leaguers left, the Team discussed the trap. Someone tipped off the villains.After being contacted ultrasonically by Lex Luthor, Superboy admitted to the Team that only half his DNA was human, he had been using shields, and that Luthor wanted him to go to Santa Prisca. Hearing this, Artemis came clean as well. She revealed her family secrets, that her mother was Huntress, her father Sportsmaster and her sister Cheshire. Suddenly, it all made sense to Kid Flash; why she was so secretive, and why she dropped the ball in New Orleans. After Robin explained to her that he had found out, but thought it didn't matter, Kid Flash walked beside her to support her. After Miss Martian revealed she was being blackmailed by Queen Bee, they formed a plan.Kid Flash was part of the back-up crew, called in if the fight broke loose. He first attacked Cheshire, and then tried to run at Sportsmaster. His attack was parried, however, and Sportsmaster threw him into a tree. By the time he'd recovered, Artemis had defeated her father, and gave Kid Flash his mask as a souvenir.Having returned from Santa Prisca, the Team learned from Batman that Red Arrow was the mole and a clone, and that the real Roy Harper was likely dead. Wally was shocked, and no one could believe it. As soon as Batman left, Red Tornado powered down. Kid Flash discovered Tornado held one of the chips they had confiscated off Cheshire. Kid Flash, Zatanna and Rocket stayed with Robin to try and fix Red, while the others went looking for Red Arrow.Zatanna suggested moving Tornado's consciousness into the "John Smith" android. While the transfer was completing, Black Canary arrived, and attacked them. Kid Flash was knocked back; Robin and Rocket defeated her. Red Tornado told them to abandon the Cave, and on their way to the rest of the Team, he explained the entire League had been put under mind control by the LightThe Team traveled to the Watchtower in the Bio-Ship and entered it clandestinely by breaching a hole in the side. Breaking into tactical teams, the Team split up. Artemis and Kid Flash ambushed Plastic Man and gave him cure-tech. Moving on, they soon found themselves fighting for their lives against Flash, Green Arrow and Aquaman in the hangar, requiring them to call in backup from the rest of the Team. Aqualad defeated them by opening and then closing the air lock, causing the Leaguers to hit the air-lock doors. When they made it to the central hall, they saw Klarion and Vandal Savage teleport away. January 2011: At the stroke of New Year, Kid Flash picked up Artemis and they kissed. Both agreed they should have done it sooner. 2011-2015: Kid Flash left the team and gave up his superhero persona. He moved in with his girlfriend Artemis, and they both live in Palo Alto and go to college. February 2016: Wally, along with Nightwing, Black Canary, Green Arrow, and the former Guardian, tried to talk some sense into Red Arrow. Nightwing and Wally reasoned that they never knew the real Speedy, and that the cloned Roy Harper was the one that the two met and trained along side. Their appeal was to deaf ears.After the failed attempt to convince Red Arrow of their friendship, Wally returned home to his house. Artemis greeted him, and tried to console him. Wally remembered that it's Valentines Day for the first time in five years and Artemis prepared a new stock full of food for their refrigerator as a gift. Wally hugged Artemis, but she could tell he was still worried about Roy. Wally called him a lost cause.</hero:mediaDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool has T-Ray, Ajax, Dr. Killbrew, Black Swan, and Madcap. T-Ray, whom Deadpool calls the "the-loathe-of-my-life," isn't just a fellow mercenary and jealous jerkass out to kill Deadpool as a professional rival. T-Ray targets Deadpool's supporting characters, enlists Typhoid Mary who bed tricks Deadpool, publicly kicks Deadpool's ass after he's traumatized by Typhoid, plays vicious headgames, and in the Twist Ending to Joe Kelly's run claims to be the real Wade Wilson. And he wears a stupid bandage on his nose. In Deadpool's backstory, Dr. Killebrew used Wade as a human test subject with the sadistic assistance of his strongarm Francis Fanny aka Ajax film In the first Deadpool film, he and Dr. Killebrew became the composite character renamed Francis Freeman aka Ajax. Wade was Driven to Suicide by the unending medical torture and fell in love with Death herself, but his repeated attempts to "join" her were thwarted to keep him alive for more experiments. Then Wade realized he could provoke "Francis" into killing him. It worked too well; Ajax murdered other patients to torment Wade, then ripped out Wade's heart. Wade's desire for vengeance kept him from Death's embrace; his heart regenerated, but his sanity was broken. Wade became "Deadpool" and seemingly killed Ajax. In Kelly's Deadpool run, Ajax resurfaces and kills Deadpool— but Deadpool has Purpose-Driven Immortality to kill Ajax. Wade's old murdered friends believe Deadpool's vendetta is their Unfinished Business, and they goad him into dropping his ongoing non-murdering hero attempts so he'll fulfill his destiny and kill Ajax. Years later, Francis comes back again when Thanos and Deadpool clash over Death. Madcap and Deadpool are both unstable pranksters with regenerative powers. However, Madcap's even crazier and has a much better healing factor than Wade. Madcap's mind accidentally gets fused into Deadpool's after Thor lightning-zaps them into ashes (It Makes Sense in Context). Unbeknownst to Deadpool, the new "white caption box" voice in his mind is actually Madcap inside him. After being literally separated from Deadpool, the experience harmed Madcap in a way he never felt before. Developing a deep, personal hatred of Wade, Madcap became obsessed with completely destroying Deadpool's life and loved ones. After framing him for murders he didn't commit, very nearly killing his daughter, and several of his closest friends, Deadpool hated Madcap to an even greater extent than his past arch enemies and people like the Weapon X program and Sabertooth (who Wade believed murdered his past family). By the time Deadpool finally gets rid of Madcap, the latter doesn't mind simply because Wade himself has already managed to completely ruin his own life, with Madcap declaring the actual death he was going to give to Wade's family wholly inferior to the spiritual one Wade himself gave them.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">However, it was not to be. Less than a year after Apollo and Midnighter's retirement, nearly the entire Stormwatch team was slaughtered in an Aliens/Stormwatch Crossover. Jenny Sparks would develop her vision for a new team, known as the Authority, and she approached Apollo and Midnighter about joining. Reluctantly (and because of Apollo), Midnighter agreed. It was then that he would take his place as "Night's Bringer of War," on a team consisting of Apollo, Swift, Jack Hawksmoor, the Engineer, the Doctor, and Jenny Sparks. His relationship with Apollo would only be hinted at until the Regis story arc, in which it was confirmed they were a couple.Of the many foes Midnighter faced with the Authority perhaps the most life-altering was the very governments they sought to improve. At one point, the political powers of Earth attempted to overpower the Authority and replace them with The New Authority, consisting of Surgeon, Teuton, Machine, Last Call, Rush, Street, and Union Jack. Of his team members, only Midnighter (along with baby Jenny Quantum) managed to escape capture and evade detection. His skills would ultimately free and save all the other original members of the Authority, though it very nearly cost him his life. Midnighter is notable for being one of the few gay superheroes in print. After his near death at the hands of government creation Seth (where even his backup heart was ripped from his chest), he married his longtime partner, Apollo, in a civil service on the The Carrier. Together, they adopted the reincarnation of Jenny Sparks, Jenny Quantum, as their daughter.Recently, even this happiness has been short lived. Midnighter was manipulated into believing that an Apollo from the future contacted him to tell him how the the Authority would ultimately become the very world oppressors they sought to overcome. This information prompted Midnighter to leave the team, as well as his husband and daughter, and to work alone for a time. However, it was discovered he was being controlled by a still-living Henry Bendix, who then set him in battle against his previous team members after getting on board The Carrier. Fortunately, Bendix's control over Midnighter was broken by the combined efforts of Jenny Quantum and Engineer, freeing him to once again join the team and be with Apollo.</hero:storyDescription>

Even more shocking would be Mercedes' return from the dead. Wade views this as a chance for redemption. The mystical mercenary T-Ray confronts Deadpool, claiming that he can't find it with her since Deadpool isn't her husband, T-Ray is. Deadpool launches into a pitched battle against the sorcerer, who manages to get the better of 'Pool by forcing him to confront all the people he's killed.

After his character development, Deadpool lampshaded this and used it as an excuse for why he hadn't appeared in a Marvel/DC Crossover. When he finally appeared in one, guess who he encountered... In tribute to this origin, Joe Kelly (Deadpool's first ongoing writer) wrote a story where the Earth-3 Deathstroke acts like and is implied to be Deadpool. In Deathstroke's own early 90s book, a "long lost half-brother" named "Wade Le Farge" (Forge? Farce?) showed up wanting to become Deathstroke and take away everything that belonged to him in gruesomely irrational fashion.</hero:tropeDescription>

They figured out that the bullet that had killed Orion had been sent through time thanks to the chair which acted as a gateway. Suddenly, a light filled the room and from within the portal of the chair came Wally's former mentor and idol, Barry Allen. Barry was chasing the bullet that killed Orion through time but was being pursued by Black Racer. Wally and Jay joined him in the race to save Orion's life but they were too late, Orion was killed. Jay was forced to abandon the chase due to not being able to keep up but Wally and Barry tried to escape the Black Racer, ending up in the near future where the world had been taken over by the Evil Gods thanks to the Anti-Life Equation. They visited Wally's Aunt Iris' house to find even she had been corrupted by Anti-Life. After freeing her from the Equation, Barry and Wally tried to come up with a plan to stop Darkseid, who had now taken over the world. They once again ran, the Black Racer catching up with them, and went into a full sprint for Darkseid. The Black Racer was gaining on them as they approached Darkseid, who was in the middle of battling Superman with his followers. The Flashes saved Superman from the followers' omega beams and when they managed to get to Darkseid, they vibrated through him, causing the Black Racer to crash into him, severely wounding the Evil God. After Darkseid was defeated, Barry and Wally reunited with the rest of their friends and family. Superman assembled Wally along with both generations of the Titans, to reveal that Bart Allen and Superboy had been resurrected in the future and brought back to the present. Wally couldn't be more overjoyed to see his cousin back.</hero:storyDescription>

She gains a massive strength boost easily putting her in class 100+ as she was able to fight and defeat a Mjolnir wielding Thor without much difficulty using nothing but physical combat. In her diamond form, she becomes almost completely invulnerable as X-23's adamantium claws could not cut her.Perhaps Emma's most unique ability gained from the Phoenix is when Thor "shattered" her, (it is possible Emma feigned Thor actually shattering her considering she was playing with him the entire fight) she had conscious control over all the fragments and rained them down through him and then reformed herself, showing Emma in her diamond form combined with the Phoenix Force is possibly unkillable. Despite her new found powers, Emma is not without weakness. Special Shi'ar weaponry, the Iron Fist energy from K'un-Lun and the Scarlet Witch's chaos magic have all been shown to harm them. However, as the Avatars gained more power when one falls, the Scarlet Witch's magic has grown to be less and less effective.

    <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Like She-Hulk, Deadpool is one of the few characters known for breaking the fourth wall. This trend started in the late '90s when it was made popular by Joe Kelly. Deadpool breaks the fourth wall by talking about his own comic (sometimes even having copies of it somehow), referring to artists or writers or even the reader, and discussing comics in general. He is most known for, however, talking to the yellow narration bubbles that his comic has. There have been several theories as to what the boxes really are but no one other than Deadpool can see them in continuity and therefore many people in the Marvel Universe think Deadpool is crazy. Deadpool also references popular media culture in the comics such as video games, celebrities, social networking, and what's going on with the real world at the time.</hero:powerDescription>

Early on in New Teen Titans he was in love with Raven, and after Rebirth retconned it to have briefly dated Omen, then dated his neighbour Frankie Kane, which ended when he became The Flash. He briefly dated Dr. Tina McGee, then hooked up with an actress named Connie, though due to their relationship being open, he was teased with Power Girl, Icicle's granddaughter, and Golden Glider. When he was still yet to start dating Linda, he was teased with then-just debuting Jesse Quick, and later had it established she was carrying a torch for him. Both Max and Jay expressed thinking they'd have been a cute couple, and then long after this during Rebirth he was teased with Donna Troy after Linda forgot about him. This is all without getting into his Silver Age adventures, where Wally had a different girl he was romancing in just about every appearance.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When Scott Summers and Wolverine visited the United Nations to speak at an International Arms Control Conference, they were surprised to find another mutant in attendance: Quentin Quire, aka Kid Omega. Quentin used his vast psychic powers to force the world leaders in the room to reveal their deepest darkest secrets on live television. This incident sparked worldwide outrage and widespread panic. Mutant hysteria was at an all-time high as world leaders took old models of Sentinels that had been commissioned long ago out of storage. The Sentinels in nearly every country had been reactivated and were on the lookout for mutants. Emma Frost broadcast a telepathic message to every remaining mutant on the planet, warning them about the sentinels, and urging them to lay low. Emma also ran telepathic surveillance with the Stepford Cuckoos as teams were deployed into the field to destroy the sentinels. The old models began to malfunction and began attacking everyone around them - not just humans. Soon thereafter, Quentin Quire turned up on Utopia seeking sanctuary. Wolverine decided against it, but Cyclops allowed him to stay. He was sent to a room, but not without a stern warning from Emma. While most X-Men were out dealing with the Sentinel problem, Emma decided to visit the Museum of Mutant History located elsewhere in San Francisco on the night of its grand opening. The mutant-friendly Mayor Sinclair had invited Cyclops to the event. Cyclops decided to send the Sub-Mariner, Colossus, Iceman, and Magneto with Emma as a show of force to the outside world. While at the museum, Emma notes that she is mentioned barely four times, and in three of them, as a villain. Later, after taking photos, Emma and the X-Men are attacked by Kade Kilgore, his Inner Circle, and their henchmen. Emma's telepathy is blocked by a device activated by Maximilian Frankenstein of Kilgore's Inner Circle. He reveals there is a tiny button hidden away in his glove by his pinkie finger that allowed him to block her powers. Emma simply breaks his finger, reactivating her telepathic powers. Before she has the ability to shut down the invaders, a space slug is attached to her face, incapacitating Emma and the others. With the 'heavy hitters' down, Idie Okonkwo aka Oya, decides, based on Cyclops's orders, to attack the intruders. She burns them alive, all except for Kilgore and his Inner Circle, who escape. This attack sets Wolverine off against Cyclops, saying that it wasn't right for Oya to do what she did. Wolverine blamed Scott, and Scott accepted the blame. By the time the slug was removed from Emma's face, Cyclops and Wolverine had taken down a mega-sentinel that attacked Utopia - with the help of the mutant children.This final battle was what made up Logan's mind. He decided to leave Utopia saying that Cyclops was turning children into soldiers. Scott and Logan invited the rest of the mutants to make up their mind, and choose a side, and reassured them that there would be no hard feelings. Cyclops naturally assumed that Emma would stay on Utopia with him. Emma told him he shouldn't have assumed as much. She revealed that he has forced her to sacrifice everything she believes in, everything she loves to be with him on Utopia. She believed in teaching the next generation, not in fighting. After explaining why she should leave, Emma reveals that she liquidated her company in order to bankroll Utopia since Angel would be leaving. She did it even before Scott asked if she would be staying, showing that she'd already resolved to remain with him.</hero:storyDescription>

Jubilee was targeted by a vampire suicide bomber and was thusly transformed into a vampire, herself. The plan was to lure Logan aka Wolverine out to track her down and save her. According to Scott's plan, Logan's healing factor was temporarily negated and he turned into a vampire as well. Emma suggested finding the deceased Dracula, and reanimating him so that he might take down Xarus for them. Namor retrieved Dracula's head and Storm and Gambit were dispatched to find the body. Once put back together, Dracula threatened to simply attack Utopia himself. Eventually, Xarus led a full-scale attack on Utopia, which was defended by the "Tough Skin" squad, led by Cyclops, Emma, and Blade, the vampire hunter. Assuming her diamond form, Emma was able to effectively battle the vampire hordes because they could not bite her or do any damage. The sheer numbers of Xarus's legion soon overwhelmed the X-Men, and as they prepared to fall back, the vampire Wolverine was sent to kill Scott. It was then that Scott's plan played out, as Logan's healing factor was restored, and he returned to normalcy. Dracula's arrival saw Emma's plan play out, as father killed son, and the X-Men were able to send the vampires back to where they came from, relatively unscathed.</hero:storyDescription>

The team investigates occurrences in New Albion (which is known as California). Emma also refused Cyclops proposals stating her desire to avoid the "tedious scandal" so it would not cause any issues between the two of them. After a misunderstanding for being blamed for the deaths of the passengers in Hindenburg Disaster, the government placed the X-Society under house arrest so Emma migrated to Europe and was married to Cyclops. She later reappeared as Emmeline Frost-Summers, having married Cyclops, in the "Exaltation" storyline in "Astonishing X-Men", when Scott Summers from Earth-616 had been kidnapped by an alternate version of Charles Xavier known as "Savior". The world that this Xavier lived in was literally breaking apart, and only the power of Scott's optic beams were able to hold it together. However the price of this was the ultimate sacrifice: death. So Savior abducted the Scott Summers of various alternate Earths sacrificing them against their will to maintain his own world. Earth-616 Scott broke Emmeline out of her prison, and along with alternate versions of Storm, Nightcrawler, and Wolverine (known as Howlett only), they attempted to stop Savior. Reinforcements soon arrived in the form of Earth-616's Emma Frost and Ororo Munroe, who fought beside their alternate Earth counterparts. Emma helped Emmeline up and the two launched a telepathic assault against Savior. Once Savior had been stopped, Emmeline and the other aforementioned members of Scott's crew decided to remain there and band together to save that Earth. Emmeline revealed that the Scott she married - the Scott of Earth-889 - had suffered the fate Savior intended. He had died holding the world together with the energy of his optic beams. This makeshift new team would later become ... the X-Treme X-Men! Kurt Waggoner of the United States of California, General Howlett of the Dominion of Canada, and Emmeline Frost-Summers of the New Albion X-Society would soon be joined by Earth-616's Alison Blaire, aka Dazzler. They would embark on a journey to save different realities. The only way they could do this was by killing the evil Charles Xaviers in each reality. In first reality they traveled to, they stumbled immediately into the Pantheon of the Gods: Namor, god of the sea, Thor, god of thunder, Sabretooth, god of the wild, Warran, god of the air and sky, Draka, god of ice and snow, and Storm, the All-Mother. Emmeline bows to the gods so as not to incur their wrath. Alison has a problem doing so. After a brief battle with the gods, Xavier and Magnus arrive to whisk the team away to their version of Utopia. Emmeline and the head of Xavier, however, remain as telepathic servants to the gods. The X-treme X-Men return along with Magnus and Xavier only to find that the Xavier they thought was good was really manipulating the gods into killing mortals. The X-treme X-Men saved and freed the gods. In return for their favor, the All-Mother Storm offered them godhood. Emmeline decided to accept the offer, and the All-Mother began the transformation process. Emmeline notes that the one thing she had that was a weakness was her heart (emotion). The process of granting her godhood had removed that one weakness, and in the process, Emmeline's flesh turned to flawless diamond. Emmeline became the Diamond Queen, goddess of perfection and the mind.</hero:alternateVersions>

    <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Wade Wilson was played by Ryan Reynolds in his pre-mutated form (his mutated form was doubled mutely by Reynolds and stuntman Scott Adkins). The movie was faithful to the snarkiness and sarcasm of the character, but nothing was mentioned about his cancer nor his fourth-wall breaking. It's unknown if he was a mutant in the continuity of the film, but he displayed superhuman reflexes and skills, such as his ability to deflect bullets with his swords. He was a member of Team X, the Weapon X group of mercenaries along with Wolverine, Sabretooth, Wraith, Bolt, Agent Zero and Fred Dukes. It should be noted that in the movie, Wade Wilson does not wear the classic Deadpool outfit, but does wear a red T-shirt as a nod to his comic costume. Wade has guns here but is only seen using his katanas when in combat. Humorously, he claims that he used his katanas at his ex-girlfriend's wedding sometime before the events of the film. He is present during the mission to Africa, which is where the group first discovers adamantium. The mission ends with Wolverine leaving the group in disgust after Wade and the others inflict violence against a group of local civilians. Years later, William Stryker, the former leader of Team X, informs Wolverine that both Wade and Bolt had been murdered by Sabretooth, who has gone rogue and is now hunting down his former teammates.This turns out to be a lie, and in the film's final act, it is revealed that not only is Wade still alive, but that he has also been transformed into a superhuman killing machine known as Weapon XI. As Weapon XI, his mouth is stitched closed, all visible hair is gone, and stitch marks are still present, as he had been taken out of his procedure early to fight Wolverine. He is also infused with a variety of superpowers as a result of being given DNA injections from the various mutants Stryker had kidnapped. He is never exactly called Deadpool in the movie, however Stryker once refers to him as "the Dead Pool" in the movie. In the final battle he is able to shoot energy beams out of his eyes like Cyclops, is armed with retractable adamantium katanas from his arms, has a healing factor that heals otherwise mortal wounds in seconds, can teleport like Wraith, and is controlled technopathically through a computer by Stryker. His head is cut off by Wolverine but in a scene after the credits his charred hand is dragging itself towards the head in the rubble of the facility, whose eyes open in a conscious moan when the hand touches, hinting at the possibility of a spin-off or movie of his own.Though the pre-Weapon XI scenes were well received by fans, the film's version of Deadpool (as well as the movie itself) was highly controversial with fans, and garnered a great deal of backlash. Fans took to derisively calling the character "Barakapool" due to his resemblance to the Mortal Kombat character Baraka.</hero:mediaDescription>
    <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Deadpool is featured in the video game adaption of the Wolverine movie. He is the final boss fight (as Weapon XI) as he is in the film.</hero:mediaDescription>
    <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma appears briefly in this film and is played by Tahyna Tozzi. Emma is present in Wolverine's past and she is a mutant with the ability to turn her body in diamond form. She does not display telepathy. She is shown as the sister of Silver Fox and was a prisoner of William Stryker trying to free herself.(Note: It was later "revealed" that Emma of X-Men Origins: Wolverine wasn't the real Emma Frost. If there is any connection between Emma (X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and Emma Frost (X-Men: First Class) is still unknown.)</hero:mediaDescription>

A competing assassin named The Black Swan took them out mere seconds before Wade had a chance. Wade took the credit though and was able to parlay that reputation into a bigger operation, called DP, Inc, which now included an assistant named Sandi.Black Swan didn't appreciate Wade stealing credit, so he took his revenge. The two were seemingly killed in an explosion, however, the mix of Wade's healing factor and Black Swan's telepathy caused Black Swan's henchman, Nijo, to be resurrected from the blast with both of their powers and amnesia. He instinctively crawled back to DP, Inc, where he was taken care of by Sandi thinking he was Wade.Nijo would rebrand himself as Agent X and continue running Wade's business as Agency X. Eventually, Black Swan would walk back into his life with Wade's memory-wiped body. Swan suggested a three way mind meld to fix all of their memory problems, but Swan accidentally revealed he was planning to kill them both. So, Wade killed him before he had a chance and then had his body stuffed by a taxidermist so his healing factor couldn't bring him back.</hero:storyDescription>

He and the other speedsters, along with Linda and the twins, were sent to an alternate Earth, home of another Jay Garrick operating as the Flash. They decided to absorb the Speed Force into Bart and send him home to battle Superboy-Prime.Content with passing the Flash mantle on to Bart, Wally and Linda decided to raise their children on the alien world Savoth, where the residents were longtime friends of the Flashes. However, shortly after their arrival, the twins began to age very rapidly. The Savothians, who were advanced scholars of velocibiology, at first did not agree to help the Wests, but finally relented and agreed to train Linda to deal with the children's rapid aging.Wally, along with Linda and their children, was brought back to Earth by seven members of the Legion of Super-Heroes using lightning rod devices. When Wally came back, he indirectly took away Bart's portion of the Speed Force, and with the return of Wally West, the Speed Force also returned as he mainlined it and was practically one with it. He was then invited to join the newly reformed Justice League of America. Wally and Linda moved back to Keystone City. Since they were afraid the twins could, at any time, age rapidly, possibly even to old age and death, they decided to let Iris and Jai, who had developed their own superspeed-related abilities, live their lives to the fullest by helping their father fight crime. Not long after, Wally found himself once again pulling a double-shift for two separate teams. He reunited with his old allies the Titans in order to face the pressing threat of Trigon.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma Frost was recruited by a mysterious boss during the events of Original Sin to join a team of three that included Ant-Man and the Black Panther. Other teams of two or three were also being formed, and each group led a mini-investigation of the death of Uatu the Watcher. Their investigations would eventually lead all the involved parties to a supposedly secret space station, in which all the teams argued with each other and tried to answer some of their questions. Who had led them there? Who were they working for? And why? Fighting broke out as an enraged Gamora threatened the Winter Soldier who appeared to have murdered Nick Fury. Emma Frost came to his defense, shifting into diamond form, and smashing her fist into Gamora, who returned the blow in kind. Eventually, things cleared up. The Nick Fury that Bucky had "killed" was actually a Life Model Decoy. The real Nick Fury revealed himself to the teams as the mysterious boss that they had been working for. He explained his story to them - that he was the "man on the wall" doing terrible things to defend Earth. He had selected each of them and led them to the space station so that he might choose one of them to become his successor. He believed they each possessed a special and lethal set of skills that would make them right for the job. The Avengers back on Earth soon caught on, and made their way to the space station to investigate. A battle between the Avengers, Fury, and Fury's possible successors ensued. When all was cleared up, and Fury was presumed dead, the heroes, including Emma returned to Earth ... except for Thor, who because of something Fury whispered to him, was unworthy of his hammer, and could no longer lift it.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:alternateVersions rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This version of Deadpool is Frederick Wilson, the nephew of President Woodrow Wilson. Freddy is enlisted by his uncle in World War 1. In order to get out of service, Freddy smokes too much and tries to pretend to have mustard gas poisoning, but his plan fails and he damages his lungs. Forced to wear a breathing apparatus, he lived the next decade losing his mind in isolation and poverty, and spent much of his time watching cartoons at the theater. During World War 2, he's convinced by Nazis to become a German super soldier and is given increased physical abilities and rapid healing as well as increased resilience to wounds due to his scabbed and callous skin - he's dubbed "Weapon Swastika." He's then sent to steal Captain America's would-be shield during the forging process, but decides that he's not a traitor and goes rogue. This Deadpool also breaks the 4th wall, but sees the world as a cartoon and has knowledge of future lingo and trends.</hero:alternateVersions>

Unable to use his telepathy, the man tried to talk some sense into the students, who'd hooked him up on the wall. They were determined to ruin the school's Open Day the next morning by staging a riot. When crowds of humans arrived to see the wonderful displays the students had created for the school, Quentin made statements about the lies of Xavier and the superiority of mutantkind. Glob Herman was lit on fire, and he began to hurl balls of flame at the crowds. Emma assumed her diamond form and helped get the humans packed onto buses and away from the dangerous Omega Gang. Quentin had already managed to subdue Wolverine and Professor X. Glob Herman, still aflame, chased the bus of humans, drawing the attention of Beast. Cyclops engaged the Omega Gang, easily taking down several members. A member known as Tattoo phased her hand through Scott's head, threatening to solidify, thereby killing him. Emma slid her diamond hand through Tattoo's own head, saying that if Tattoo solidified, she would die as well. She was able to eliminate Tattoo as a threat. Meanwhile, the Stepford Cuckoos used the powers of their hive mind while Sophie Cuckoo used the drug known as Kick and Cerebra to enhance their powers. Together they were able to subdue Quentin but at a price. Emma had gone to check on Sophie. She carried the girl's dead body to the outside of the school. The psychic strain had killed Sophie Cuckoo.</hero:storyDescription>

Tempus needed Wally's help protecting the Multiverse from dark matter that escaped the Dark Multiverse. Wally reluctantly agreed and purged the dark matter from multiple Earths, each of which helped Wally cope with the guilt of his recent actions.However, when Tempus sent Wally to a Dark Multiverse Earth to destroy it, Wally found his children alive. While Wally attempted to purge the dark matter without destroying the planet, he came across the Mobius Chair. Believing Tempus was keeping secrets, Wally reached for the chair, which sorted the broken memories that had been causing him pain. With his mind clear, Tempus revealed to him that the Dark Multiverse planet was the creation of Wally's greatest fears, which is why Tempus chose him in the first place for this quest. Wally was the reason for the invading dark matter.According to Tempus, if Wally sat in the Mobius Chair, it would fill his head with so much information, there would be no room for emotions. And thus, the dark-matter-leaking planet would cease to exist. Wally agreed to sit, as long as Tempus saved Jai and Irey after the planet was destroyed. Tempus agreed. With the power of the chair, Wally saw Jai and Irey returned to Linda and with them, all the memories of her life with Wally.On the Mobius Chair, Wally witnesses much of the multiverse. When he sees the Justice Society and the Legion of Super-Heroes return to the main timeline, he looks deeper and sees that time itself is broken. With Tempus' help, Wally would use his new abilities to solidify the strands of broken multiverse into one coherent timeline, but his efforts are interrupted by the Batman Who Laughs.</hero:storyDescription>

He's arguably the only (ex-)sidekick whose popularity holds up equally against his mentor's. Before The Flash (2014), he was even more popular with the help of his acclaimed cartoon appearances. After his erasure from the DCU, some fans even actively boycotted Flash books and DC to the point where having a Flash discussion without mentioning Wally was impossible. When his initial introduction in the New 52 was received very poorly, DC not only decided to bring him back to continuity in all his glory but also made an entire event centred around his return. Right now he's co-leading Titans (a team he was barely a side character in before, once he became the Flash) with his best friend Dick Grayson to fix the fallout of Flashpoint, the story that wiped him from existence in the first place.</hero:tropeDescription>

He imprisoned Wally on Themyscira, where Wonder Woman was forced to be the warden. With Swamp Thing, Wonder Woman broke Wally out and brought him to the hero cemetery, where Batman was planning to raise an army with a Black Lantern Ring.Wonder Woman wanted to stop Batman because she had a new idea. They would create an "Anti-Crisis" to counter Perpetua's Crisis energy using Wally's new cosmic role, granted to him by the Tempus Fuginaut. While Wonder Woman and Batman prepare, Wally was left in a bunker with Barry, Jay, and the Justice Society.They were tracked down by the Batman Who Laughs, who combined himself with Dr. Manhattan becoming the "Darkest Knight." The Darkest Knight wanted to siphon off Wally's remaining Anti-Crisis energy to become more powerful than Perpetua, so the speedsters (now joined by Wallace) were forced to flee the bunker.Unfortunately, as they ran, they were using up the Speed Force, which was almost depleted. Wally believed he needed to turn around and reconnect to the Mobius Chair. Barry reluctantly agreed and ultimately gave his speed to Wally to give him the boost he needed to outrun the Darkest Knight. He beat him to the Mobius Chair and traveled the Speed Force to reunite with Wonder Woman and carry out her plan to remake the multiverse.Unfortunately, the Darkest Knight rigged the chair, and the Anti-Crisis energy was absorbed by him instead of Wally. The Darkest Knight took on Perpetua, while the heroes regrouped on Themyscira and fought the Darkest Knight's army. After the Darkest Knight defeated Perpetua, Wonder Woman sacrificed herself to defeat him.In the wake of the new universe, Wally met the Totality and was informed of the new structure of the multiverse.</hero:storyDescription>

In this future, Charles Xavier is still alive, and both he and Emma work for Tony Stark and S.H.I.E.L.D. as telepathic informants. They scanned the minds of the time-displaced Wolverine and Invisible Woman to verify their accounts. Emma determined that they were telling the truth. In this future, Morgana Le Fay is a constant threat to the civilization built by the heroes. Emma and Xavier were sent by Stark to send the Defenders (the group that replaced the Avengers and picked up Sue and Logan) back to their Defender Sanctorum. The group did not want to comply, and forced their way into the Starkguard Carrier despite Emma and Xavier's attempts to stop them. Amidst this conflict, Morgana Le Fay commenced another attack, drawing the full attention of the Defenders of S.H.I.E.L.D. Emma presumably joined in the fight. During the chaos, Sue and Logan were able to slip away. Emma's fate after this episode is unknown.</hero:alternateVersions>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Deadpool was hired by Archangel to be on X-Force in the search for Apocalypse. Deadpool was scouting a base to find out the plans for Apocalypse's resurrection only to be captured and held captive. Later he was rescued by the rest of the team and informs them of the plan. They then head to the moon base where the Resurrected kid apocalypse (Genesis) is located. Unfortunately a new horsemen of Apocalypse took down Fantomex's E.V.A. where the team was injured and Deadpool was left with Archangel where he helped keep Archangel well by feeding him Deadpool's own flesh. Later when they finally reached the boy, the team comes to an agreement that the boy can be saved only for Fantomex to shoot Kid Apocalypse in the head. After this event, Deadpool does a recon mission only to realize that the Reavers and Lady Deathstrike are planning a attack on Utopia.The team then goes against the Reavers until Wolverine got stuck fighting Lady Deathstrike, and Deadpool and Fantomex were blown away by the Reavers leaving Warren and Psylocke to fight the Reavers. After that Deadpool had a meeting with everyone except Fantomex to talk about the apocalypse event.Deadpool then leaves the conversation saying "I don't kill kids". After that they learn that Deadpool never cashed any of Warren's checks having them realize that Deadpool is not on the team for money. Soon after the team is attacked by Deathlock versions of the Avengers and a Deathlock approaches the team with an offer to stop their creation. He joins the team on their mission to the alternate Earth where all of Earth's heroes have been made into Deathlocks. The team is attacked by Deathlock versions of themselves who are more deadly than the originals. Fantomex uses his misdirection to allow them to escape. Deadpool is the one who kills the source of this reality's problems, world father by decapitating him.Deadpool also accompanies the team into the Age of Apocalypse. While X-Force seeks out Dark Beast, Deadpool frequently comments on how he cant be trusted. When they are abandoned in the AoA universe he is mistaken for Dead Man Wade, his counterpart in that reality. X-Force fights their way through the Black Legion in order to free a mutant who can make portals in order to get home.Through a number of adventures, the Kid-Apocalypse (now better known as Genesis) stayed with the team and formed a special bond with Deadpool. They where both misunderstood beings. Deadpool, a mercenary for hire whom was actually a better person then he led on, and Genesis, a kind boy with running towards a legacy of evil. Deadpool wanted to make sure that Genesis would never fulfill the horrible legacy he was bread for.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool is gruesomely disfigured (which is why he rarely removes his mask), insane, and immature. Yet all of his love interests are extremely hot women. Deadpools claims to have been married at least ten times previously in Vol. 5 #27 "The Wedding of Deadpool", although not all of these stories may be accurate since he is an Unreliable Narrator. The past wives listed include Ms. Marvel  turned out she was being controlled by an alien at the time, a sock puppet of Copycat he hallucinated was really her after he thought she died  destroyed, although the real Copycat was still alive, a stripper calling herself Genosha  killed during the wedding as a consequence of Deadpool messing with continuity, a woman whose name he forgot that he assassinated by pretending to be her groom  she actually hired him to make her suicide look like a murder, a woman named Penny  she didn't exist, she was part of a trap set by a villain, a woman named Anna  he had actually killed the real Anna and married Copycat pretending to be her and it turned out the people who married them were replaced with actors so it didn't count, a Dumb Blonde named Lurleen  divorced when it turned out she was actually Mystique, Outlaw  her super strength made sex extremely painful, so probably divorced, Domino  only pretending to be a couple for a mission but Deadpool took it like it was real, and she "divorced" him by shooting through him to get the bad guy, AIM assassin Betty Swanson  didn't count, she was unconscious and the guy doing the wedding was a savage land native shaman that he coerced, and a large alien woman named Orksa  although it didn't show it in this comic, he later divorced her so she could be with somebody who loved her more than he did, and of course, the main story of the issue is him getting married to Shiklah the Succubus  but they have since separated, with Shiklah marrying Dracula like originally intended after their marriage falls apart due to Wade's negligence. Deadpool mentions in issue 31 of volume 4, that he thinks they're still technically married, but isn't sure how it works with her -being a Succubus There are also all the women he had sex with but didn't marry,  one of which had his daughter. However, may be deconstructed since Deadpool sometimes never seems to remove his mask when he with some of his ladies. When having sex with Carmelita, he keeps his suit on. He has to leave to fight, and Carmelita wishes him luck and kisses him in case something bad happens to her. She even goes to the fight scene, wondering if Deadpool is ok. However, she'd never seen his face, and when she does, she chokes back bile and runs away in disgust. Granted, his face is only a mess due to injuries. When he gets his face fixed, he is quite handsome looking.</hero:tropeDescription>

Like the Joker, Deadpool really is insane (a different kind of insane, though) and knows it, but he plays up and (possibly) exaggerates his insanity for tactical benefit. Also like the Joker, the fact that his personality changes regularly is part of canon. In his case, his healing factor and cancer have combined to leave his braincells constantly in flux. In some stories he's little more than an immature goofball, others he's perfectly capable of committing murders in cold blood that he doesn't even remember afterward. Of course, as a Meta Guy, Deadpool's also the first to admit that the real reason he changes is who is writing him at the moment.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Wally makes His debut as Kid Flash in the episode of the Teen entitled "Lightspeed". While the character's true identity is never given, the fact that Michael Rosenbaum voices the character implies that he is intended to be Wally West as Rosenbaum also voices an older Flash/Wally West in Justice League, as well as insisting he vibrated through the bars of a cage the H.I.V.E Five trapped him in, an ability only Wally has demonstrated. In the series, he is portrayed similar to the way that Wally was portrayed in comic books. His personality is often considered "laid back", and he is known to be comedic and sometimes flirtatious. When Jinx asks Kid Flash who he is working for, he says, "I work alone these days", implying a previous partnership with The Flash.When the Titans are searching for the Brotherhood of Evil and the Titans East have gone back home to Steel City, Kid Flash decides to help protect Jump City and stop crimes from being committed. When he interferes with the H.I.V.E. Five's criminal deeds, he flirts with their leader, Jinx, and tries to make her reevaluate her life of crime. Shortly afterward the H.I.V.E Five attempts to capture him and, after Madame Rouge tires him out, Jinx traps him in an electric field. Jinx nearly hands him over to Madame Rouge, but she frees him when she realizes Madame Rouge doesn't appreciate her help and that Kid Flash was the one who truly cared for her well-being. Afterward, Jinx quits the H.I.V.E. Five and joins forces with him as a Titan, and the two quickly form a romantic relationship.He briefly appears in a shot of all the Titans in "Calling All Titans", where it is revealed the Titans have come in contact with him and he has a Titan communicator. In "Titans Together", he brings Jinx to the Brotherhood's lair as his ally and helps the speedsters M's y Menos and the other Titans freeze the Brotherhood's member villains inside cryogenic cases. M's y Menos are very impressed by Kid Flash's speed and abilities.Kid Flash is one of the few Titans in the animated series to fully resemble his comic counterpart. However, Wally's eyes in the comics are currently green. The design of Kid Flash with blue eyes remains consistent with his original appearances, pre-Crisis.</hero:mediaDescription>

The virus will do nothing to Wade, given his healing factor, but Madcap planned on using Wade to spread it to his loved ones as a way of finally breaking him. Wade has to find a cure to save everyone, and none of his friends are available to help him, so he turns to Stryfe.Stryfe gives him the cure to save everyone, but states it will cost him. He will save four lives for Wade. In exchange, Wade will have to claim four lives for him. Wade asks Stryfe who he wants dead, but Stryfe doesn't wish to reveal that info just yet. He simply tells Wade to think of it as a long-term payment plan. Wade doesn't want to owe Stryfe anything and gives him the cure back until Styfe tells him that everyone will die, Preston's husband being the first to go. Stryfe asks if Wade will let his family suffer because of him. Wade accept the cure, and Stryfe's deal to save his family.Wade returns with the cure, and manages to have Ellie, and Preston's family. Preston sits with Wade and the kids, asking if they're ready to go home. Wade tells Ellie to fist-bump him, prompting Ellie to ask if she's gonna be poisoned again. Wade says there's only one way to find out. Preston tells Wade to kiss Cable for her, to thank him for the cure. Wade pauses, and tells her sure, before being shown moping due to now being indebted to Stryfe, unbeknownst to anyone else.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool has this with a lot of people, mainly Cable and Spider-Man. Uncanny Avengers has Rogue and Deadpool playing this trope big time. Rogue couldn't stand him at first, but they slowly developed a genuine bond -enough so that Wade takes Rogue to see his daughter, whom he asks Rogue to watch over if she becomes a mutant. Rogue readily agrees to have Ellie's back. In addition to shared moments here and there between the two that hint at deeper feelings. It finally comes to a head in chapter 22, when Rogue gives him The Big Damn Kiss. Afterwards, Deadpool tells her that she deserves better, and that she only likes him because she doesn't fully know him. Rogue kisses him again -unmoving in her feelings. She tells him that the stuff in his head is a relief after having Red Skull in her's. He notes that as the most romantic thing anyone's said to him. In the next panel we see them continuing their kissing elsewhere. invoked Word of God states that the two seem very lonely, and admits that while the majority were rooting for Rogue and Gambit, he wanted to try something new and unexpected. Chapter 23's recap classifies Rogue and Deadpool's evening previous chapter as their first date. However it doesn't last as Rogue goes back to Gambit when Kitty and Colossus are unable to go though with their wedding and Gambit proposes to her. They are Happily Married and Deadpool shows up on their honeymoon, being a bit jealous of Gambit.</hero:tropeDescription>

They were genetically commingled, so that "one phone call" would have happened even without intent....And Cable needed to make that contact to manipulate Deadpool into Doing The Right Thing. Both Cable and Deadpool are well aware of their Life Partner status, especially evidenced when they both regularly called the time during a small falling out between them ("Small falling out" in this case being Deadpool's new membership in a mercenary group hired to destabilize Cable's fictional country Providence. Said membership was revealed when 'Pool shot Cable in the back of the head.) a "divorce". Despite their split, the two have a secret pact no one else has been clued in on; they will protect each other's loved ones if the other dies by destroying the deceased's safe houses. Once when asked about his relationship with Cable by well-known gun-for-hire The Cat, Deadpool responded that it was a 'Don't ask/Don't tell deal'. Feel free to interpret that however, you wish.

He has posters of her, tapes her face over pinups, apparently has a shrine to her, and frequently references her in loving terms. In the early to mid 2000s, Deadpool expresses patriotic sentiments about America, calls himself a red-blooded American, addresses then-president George W. Bush as his own president, talks about growing up in Ohio, and more. The Canadian government that gave him his healing factor isn't his own. But then in 2008, as if Deadpool and his readers got kicked in the head by a retconning moose, he's Canadian-born, Canadian-bred, proud to be Canadian, is confused about historic American presidents but knows all of Canada's prime ministers, and is now included on lists of famous fictional Canadians and portrayed in live-action films by Canadian Ryan Reynolds.</hero:tropeDescription>

One of their missions is to capture both Hulk and Wolverine to use them as deadly weapons in Weapon X. He often annoys Omega Red with his jokes.

I'm alive! I'M ALIIIVE-" in which he is then stomped on by Hulk. The screen goes back to Deadpool as he whimpers a weak. "Ow..." He is voiced by Nolan North.</hero:mediaDescription>

Visual input will begin to blueshift, and his body's mass will increase towards infinity. With this ability, he was able to knock out a Martian Speedster Zum (who is as durable/tough as Superman) from Mount Rushmore to the plains of Africa, all with one devastating punch and left him KO'd for several minutes despite the fact that the Martians have incredible healing factor.</hero:powerDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Stormwatch tries to convince Apollo to join their team, however Apollo is reluctant to do so and that is when Midnighter appears and dispatches the three Stormwatch members that were there, namely Martian Manhunter, Jack Hawksmoor and the Projectionist. He then reveals that he has been following Apollo for quite some time now and has taken an interest upon him because of his power set and the way that he deals with threats. He then offers him a deal of partnership. Martian Manhunter then reveals that he was pretending to be out cold so that he could get a grasp of the situation and the threat presented, and tells the duo that Stormwatch could use both Apollo and Midnighter. He explains that Stormwatch is not in fact a regular superhero team and that the team has little qualms with killing.During this time Adam-One shows up through a door and offers Midnighter a place on the team as well, telling him that his skills are wasted against thugs and criminals when he could be defending the planet with Stormwatch. However, at the same time that this was happening Harry Tanner was up on the moon trying to deal with a alien threat, called the Scourge of Worlds that sent pieces of the moon as meteorites into Earth's atmosphere. This cut short the conversation and Apollo agreed to go deal with the meteors while Midnighter went to deal with a fallen meteor that turned into a rampaging antibody. When they arrived at the scene the antibody proved troublesome and absorbed all the members of Stormwatch present, with the exception of Midnighter. Apollo soon joins him and the two of them, in conjuction with the Projectionist [who was at the base] manage to come up with a successful plan to free their 'team members'. With this done, it allowed Hawksmoor to lead half of the team into an ancient formerly-underground city called Alba Umbra and from there allow Jenny Quantum to power up one of the cities' artifacts to turn the monster into glass.When the team returns to the Eye they discover that the Shadow Cabinet has chosen the Projectionist to be Stormwatch's new leader. While this is going on, Apollo and Midnighter slip away to explore the HQ. Midnighter tells Apollo that the two of them would be more effective together than as components of Stormwatch, since their goals differ greatly from the team's. There is a sudden emergency distress signal from hyperspace, and Apollo leaves to investigate it. Midnighter realizes that the emergency was just a distraction orchestrated by Harry Tanner so that he could steal the Stormwatch data caches. The two fight, with Tanner struggling to land a blow because of Midnighter's ability to predict every one of his moves. Just then, they are interrupted by Projectionist, whom Harry grabs and pulls into hyperspace with him, escaping after setting off a bomb on the alien horn that destroys the Eye. The force of the explosion throws Midnighter into hyperspace, where he lingers for a few death-defying moments until he is rescued by Apollo and taken back to the reformed Eye to be treated for his exposure to the hazardous environs of hyperspace. A short while later, he signs up with Stormwatch after a conversation with the Engineer, managing to persuade Apollo to join as well.</hero:storyDescription>

After many difficulties, Wade disbands from his mercs and they burn their contracts. He later drops by to visit Preston, who makes clear he's not welcome due to how out of control he's been acting as of late. He also discovers Ellie calling him by his first name, which throws him off. She reveals that her therapist told her that she shouldn't consider him a father-figure. Preston punches him, using her robot strength, and slams the door in his face. Ellie looks out of the window and tells him bye. Wade just thinks to himself that he deserves whatever he gets.After the failure of his mercs, and being kicked out by Preston, he returns home to Shiklah -complaining about his luck. It's at this time he finally discovers Shiklah's infidelity. He finds Jack in bed with Shiklah, and blows his head off with a shotgun, despite Jack trying to explain himself. Shiklah tells him that they talked about it before, and he knows they're both allowed a certain number of "invitations". Wade tells her she's expanding her guest list. As Shiklah denies this claim, a female monster emerges from under the duvet, and runs away in fear of Deadpool. He asks her to explain the other monster, and she then confesses that there have been many visitors to her chambers. She lists off the other lovers she's had, and Wade interrupts her angrily saying that he gets the point. Shiklah tells him he knew who he was marrying.The two end up in a fight, which leads from Shiklah's chambers all the way to the streets of Manhattan while they continue to argue about their marriage. Shiklah goes from being angry to excited, telling Wade she's missed him. He says it's good he can still make her horny, before receiving a kick to the stomach. As he lies on the ground, Shiklah tells him that the humans he loves will all die. Wade asks her what she said. He angrily delivers a kick to her face, once again asking her to repeat what she just said. Shiklah asks Wade if he thought she was threatening his loved ones. She says maybe she was. Wade asks if they can just be done with their fighting now. He offers to get a dog, and let Shiklah shoot it in his bed.Shiklah calms down, and relents on the fighting, She puts a foot on Wade's throat, and tells him that was the most fun they'd had in a while. She invites him back to bed, but he declines going back to the bed he just shot the werewolf in. Shiklah tells him Jack will be fine. His head will regenerate, but he'll have a puppy face for a while. She once again invites him to come back down, stating it could be romantic. Wade still passes on the offer. She laughs and tells him it's fine. She takes her leave, but not before saying it's never the end for them. This confuses Deadpool, who's surprised that Shiklah doesn't want their relationship over.He wonders around Manhattan dejected before moving some of his weapons into the old Avengers hideout, which is in ruins. It's there he meets Rogue, he tells her about his marital problems with Shiklah, before asking her for a favor. He takes her to see Ellie, and asks if she'll look out for her if she gets mutant powers one day. Rogue says she'll have Ellie's back.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:alternateVersions rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">On this Earth, the Fantastic Four disbanded back in the Silver Age after their disastrous first battle against Galactus, which ended with the brutal death of Ben Grimm and Doctor Doom becoming the new devourer of worlds after stealing Galactus' body. The ripple effect of this incident led to a greatly altered Marvel Universe, with most of the planet's heroes becoming agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. after the events of the Secret Invasion. For unknown reasons, Emma Frost did not end up as one of these heroes, and instead married Norrin Radd, who'd lost his abilities after relinquishing the Power Cosmic to Johnny Storm. The two retired to a small farm together, but their peaceful existence was disturbed when the Earth-616 versions of Johnny and Ben arrived in search of help. Emma fired at the two with a shotgun, apparently believing them to be Skrull impostors, but agreed to hear them out after using her telepathy to confirm they were who they claimed to be. Learning that Doom was returning to consume the planet, Emma attempted to use her powers to switch bodies with him, but was bound and gagged by Doom's Earth-616 counterpart, who sought to take Emma's place and became the new devourer of worlds. However, Johnny convinced him to let Emma do it instead, and Doom eventually relented. Emma successfully completed the body switch, and was able to rewrite Galactus' own nature, causing the creature to become a Lifebringer rather than a destroyer. Now in Galactus' body, Emma and the repowered Silver Surfer set out to recreate the universe.</hero:alternateVersions>

In an effort to free him, the X-Men battled Chinese militants and John Sublime's U-Men. Eventually, Xorn was free of captivity. Disgusted with the life he knew, he was attempting to overload his powers, which would destroy life on Earth. Emma used her telepathy to psychically "download" the Chinese language into Cyclops's mind. Scott was able to talk Xorn down, and even offered him a place on the X-Men.Soon later, Xavier (which was still really Cassandra Nova) outed himself as a mutant on a live talk show. Many reacted to this in a negative way, and soon a large crowd formed outside the school, comprised of protesters, mutant-haters, and the media. Xavier (Nova) decided to visit Charles's lady love, the Empress Lilandra Neramani of the Shi'ar Empire. He left the planet, leaving the team to deal with the new students, the protesters, and Sublime. Jean tried addressing the crowd, but her efforts bore no fruit. Emma, tired of waiting around for Jean's method to work, telepathically brought every member of the crowd to orgasm, simultaneously. They each passed out, and when they woke up, they left in their shame.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool's appearance was horrific when it was first seen, due to the artificial origin of his healing factor reacting with incurable cancer. Over time, it changed and simplified from "bubbles and nodules of flesh with random hair" to "flesh-coloured de-uglified Ben Grimm", and some artists go even further. In Cable &amp; Deadpool, about 75% of his skin actually looked perfectly normal, with the rest just resembling bad acne. Didn't stop people from nearly retching when they saw him on the street. This is another that goes back and forth depending on who's drawing him, since sometimes he looks alright, others he's back to his horrific look. Since his power has been described as leaving his body tissue in constant, dynamic flux, this makes sense. There was a time he was given the face of Thom Cruz, and spent most of the issue trying to get rid of it.</hero:tropeDescription>

In fact, this would seem especially odd given the later X-Force issue where Emma told Warpath that she approved of his decision to leave the Hellions, and that she never would've forced any of her students to stay with her if they hadn't wanted to.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:alternateVersions rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe, Deadpool kills the Marvel Universe. The Watcher watches in horror as one of the most tasteless of worlds unfolds before him. In this universe, Deadpool is victim to a freak counselling session where Psycho Man attempts to use mind-control to force Wade into being his slave assassin. The Watcher claims that Psycho Man's plan succeeds in other universes and he uses an army of brain-washed heroes and villains to take over the world. But, something even worse happens in this particular universe. Psycho Man fails to overtake DP. And, although Psycho Man is murdered by DP (along with the rest of the employees and patients of the psychiatric institute), his attempt at mind control unlocks a new inner-voice. This voice continues to insist that DP kill the entirety of the Marvel Universe, to spare them from the misery they're put through for the entertainment of readers. Deadpool succeeds, continuously, breaking the fourth wall saying that this is what the readers wanted. Some of the notable scenes of the book are when Wade kills the Fantastic Four, Hulk, the Punisher, Taskmaster, Wolverine and the Watcher himself.At the end of the series, Man-Thing sacrifices himself as a portal to the comic book writer's dimension where he intends to follow through in killing not only his own Marvel Universe, but all of the Universes in existence. The last panel concludes with Wade standing near the bickering creators of Deadpool Kills The Marvel Universe, breaking the fourth wall with a threat (or is it a promise?) to find the reader "soon enough."</hero:alternateVersions>

Hilariously, unlike the description given above, he actually is Ax-Crazy...which makes him a whole lot of fun. He also strays into Crazy Is Cool sometimes; for example, when he fights with absolutely no semblance of sense, not even deciding what an attack is going to be until it connects, to beat the Taskmaster. However, Taskmaster himself called Deadpool out for this, telling him that one of the reasons he's not taken seriously and doesn't make nearly as much money as he could is because he's so crazy that it's even more crazy for people to think they can rely on him. Hell, in some of his earliest incarnations, he would change sides in the middle of a fight if he was offered more money. If you have a hopeless suicide mission, call Deadpool. If you need subtlety and discretion, stay light-years away from him. Also, since Deadpool has developed a conscience and tries to do the right thing, there's no guarantee that he won't turn on someone who just paid him if he thinks the situation warrants it.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">It soon becomes clear that Wade's healing factor is flawed, as it allows him to heal faster than his cancer can kill him, hideously disfiguring him. Since his cells are in constant flux, his brain is unstable, contributing to his madness. As a costumed mercenary, Deadpool frequents the horrific Hell House, where he receives assignments. Eventually Tolliver, the man who runs the hangout, sends Deadpool to kill Cable. The mercenary fails when his attack is thwarted by Domino (who is actually his old girlfriend Copycat [Vanessa Carlyle] posing as Domino with a counter mission to blow up Cable's whole X-Force team; a mission sanctioned by Tolliver himself). Cable and X-Force, including the fake Domino, mail Deadpool back to Tolliver.Deadpool becomes Tolliver's lap dog. Deadpool runs various operations on behalf of his employer, like overseeing the shipping of dangerous goods. Garrison Kane, on behalf of the Canadian government, breaks up this operation but lets Deadpool teleport away when he gets distracted by the appearance of G.W. Bridge. He next is sent to the World Trade Center to abduct Black Tom Cassidy who had just been thoroughly shot by Cable. Deadpool also gets Black Tom's partner the Juggernaut to accompany them to Tolliver's. There, Black Tom is operated on and infused with plant life. Black Tom would later leave Tolliver's house.Deadpool's next mission from Tolliver is more personal - he's to track down Vanessa, impersonating Domino within the ranks of X-Force, and find out why she hasn't completed her mission. He infiltrates the X-Force base in the Adirondack Mountains and engages her in a royal tussle. He defeats her and convinces her to finish her job for Tolliver and then to rejoin the team. Vanessa is found by Cable and she continues to lie by stating that she is Domino but was hired by Tolliver to kill him. Cable then takes the fight to Tolliver. Deadpool protects his boss by stabbing Vanessa and then going one-on-one with Cable. Deadpool loses and passes out. Once Cable leaves to kill Tolliver (after finding and freeing the real Domino) in a helicopter explosion, Deadpool awakens to find that Vanessa has slinked off. He begins to hunt for her.</hero:storyDescription>

She manipulated Firestar since the beginning of her relationship, but was sincere with Kitty, without any mind control, offering Kitty her mentorship.

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Since the late 2000s, Deadpool began rivaling good ol' Wolverine himself as Marvel's Poster Child with multiple simultaneous comic books of his own plus so-called guest appearances that are sometimes with characters he's never met or just for a single panel. Within one year (Fall '08–Fall '09) alone, he was granted three of his own ongoing titles (more than Iron Man and Captain America combined) and a confirmed place as a regular character in X-Force, given his first animated speaking role (Hulk vs. Wolverine), confirmed as making his first speaking television debut (Season 2 of The Super Hero Squad Show), made one of the most prominent characters of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, ... errr... "featured" in a live-action film, and later rebooted in a new timeline.  In 2010, there was a Marvel Team-Up between Deadpool and It the Living Colossus. For all that Deadpool actually did to help, it was basically an It one-shot. It seems Deadpool's role in this team-up was just to get people to buy the book. Sorry, did we say Marvel Team-Up? Our mistake — the book's called Deadpool Team-Up. Yes, Deadpool was the star of a Marvel Team-Up book — meaning Marvel editorial already considered Deadpool a flagship character. Oh, and Deadpool Team-Up started with issue 900 and counts down from there. Granted, this was a joke about the then-current release of Action Comics 900 — the series got canned after a little over a year. Similar to the Wolverine variant covers, Deadpool was for one month featured on numerous variant covers, though the series were mainly in the Marvel Universe. The covers ranged from slight alterations of the original covers to parodies of classic covers (One Amazing Spider-Man cover parodied Amazing Spider-Man Annual #21, and featured Deadpool smoozing up Mary-Jane and pushing Spidey out of the way) to at least one completely original cover. He's prominently displayed on most of the artwork for Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and shown opposite Dante in the intro. His eventual burst of popularity is lampshaded by She-Hulk in the game, who annoyedly points out to Deadpool that in the 80s and early 90s she was very popular and even shared his signature fourth-wall-breaking powers. In 2013, Deadpool got his own video game. The last line of the teaser trailer? "Suck it, Wolverine!" He's also given a prominent position on the promo◊ for the LEGO Marvel Super Heroes game, right up there with the cast of The Avengers movie, Spider-Man, and you guessed it, Wolverine. In this interview, the writer of the 2010 Ant-Man and the Wasp miniseries felt the need to specify that neither Wolverine nor Deadpool appears in it. Lampshaded in one solicitation for Secret Avengers</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma stays with Scott on Utopia where she liquidates her company in order to bankroll Utopia for the time being. She is on Scott's Extinction Team along with Hope, Colossus, Magik, Danger, Magneto, Namor and Storm. Emma and the team are alarmed of the Dreaming Celestial being activated by Mr. Sinister. They engage him in battle and Emma ends up losing one of her diamond arms due to a blast from a celestial probe. Emma and the team fought the Sinister people until Mr. Sinister invites them into to his domain. Sinister telepathically controls the team, but due to being in her diamond form Emma is immune but surrounded. Emma told Hope a code word that replicates Emma's diamond form to protect Hope from Sinister prior to entering his domain. With Sinister shot through the head by Hope thanks to Emma, the team is freed from his telepathic control but Sinister predicts this would happen and the team learns Sinister's copies have become a hive-mind-like species.Emma and the team continue to battle the Sinister Species when Emma realizes that Sinister is using Cyclop's mind as a blueprint for his species. Emma has Namor hold her left arm as a tourniquet and abandons her diamond form where she successfully uses her telepathy to mind blast the Sinisters. However, a new Sinister arrives saying he integrated the new data that the previous Sinisters received, and shoots himself after teleporting his palace away.The Dreaming Celestial's head attaches to its body as the rest of the Celestials land. Emma is about to be told to leave by Scott but cuts him short refusing to go. The team stares the Celestials down vowing to protect the Dreaming Celestial and Earth. A group of people gathers looking at the X-men but they do nothing, no throwing things, no derogatory slurs. They only show fear which was Cyclops' initial plan all along. Emma's diamond arm was eventually reattached by a molecular weaving machine made by X-Club.Emma was seen training, getting back into to fighting condition after her arm reattachment. She had a brief conversation with Namor and left while noticing Scott was on edge about something. She was later deployed with the Extinction team to deal with the escaped prisoners from the Peak space prison station and when the Avengers showed up to deal with further escapees. She teams up with Iron Man, Colossus and Red Hulk to face Xemnu the Titan While Colossus holds off Xemnu, Emma and Tony make a psionic shielding device for the Red Hulk to protect him from Xemnu's telepathy. With the device complete, the combined might of Colossus and Red Hulk was enough to defeat the alien.With Hope taken captive by Unit, the Extinction team takes leave from the Avengers to save Hope. Emma and the team are teleported there by Magik where Emma tries to invade Unit's mind. Unit uses a fake double mind, which is what he used in the first place to make a false mutant detection signal in order to draw out Hope, allowing him the chance to shoot a small laser at Emma stunning her. He then uses a pheromone barrage on her and Namor forcing them to become intimate on the battlefield which makes Scott angry and jealous causing him to blast Unit. With Unit's eventual defeat at the hands of Danger, the team returns home where Emma apologizes to Scott for what happened with her and Namor. He tells her that he was alright with what happened since she was forced to do so and had no choice in the matter.</hero:storyDescription>

After enlisting Batwoman to help lead his new team, they begin gathering the recruits. Deciding on their second recruit, they find Orphan taking down a group of sex traffickers. After she dispatches them, Batman calls out for her to come with him. She and the other recruits arrive atop GCPD Headquarters and the two explain their plan to train them.During one of their first training sessions, the team is forced a fight a simulated army of Jokers. When Spoiler gets overwhelmed, an already fatigued Cassandra rescues her. When Red Robin shuts down the simulation against Batwoman's orders, she calls everyone out on their flawed performances. Cassandra's flaw was that she divided her attention. As the best fighter present, she focused too much on fighting for everyone. After they break for the night, Cassandra decides to drop by Stephanie and Tim's apartment, but when she sees the two are talking, she heads off to find someone to fight.Later, after Batman is captured by the Colony, Batwoman and Red Robin summon the team Cassandra is the last to arrive, but before she can go inside the Belfry, she notices jets overhead and realizes something is amiss. When Colony soldiers drop onto the roof of the Belfry and demand her surrender, she merely says "no" and charges into battle. When another contingient breaches the base, she follows them in after dispatching the first group. She tries to fight them off but they shoot her with tranquilizer darts to keep her down. She recovers as the teams uses the Belfry's escape hatch to reqroup and come up with a plan. Once Orphan confirms they are not being followed, the group head over to the Bat-Train Tim designed for fast exits. Cassandra is also present when they storm the Colony's base to free Batman. She is tasked with clearing their escape route of soldiers. By the time the others reach her, she has taken them all down, enabling them to escape.When they return to the Belfry, they discover from Tim that the Colony is trying to purge members of the League of Shadows from Gotham at the cost of several hundred innocent lives. Wanting to save as many people as possible, the team splits up to cover more ground. Cassandra is seen clearing out a shelter, unaware that member of the Shadows walked right past her. She is not seen again during the evacuation attempt.</hero:storyDescription>

With his powers gone, Barry names Wally The Flash of Central City.Grodd was sick, and he believed the Speed Force was the cure. Working with The Black Hole, they were stealing speed from the whole city. Luckily, Avery and Wallace had stolen the key to the device. Barry thinks he can use it to get his powers back, but he needs Wally to buy him some time. So, Wally attempts to evacuate the city.After Barry used the wand to get his powers back and cure Grodd, Grodd also used the wand to harness the Negative Speed Force and cause a lightning storm. Barry was content to run into the eye of the storm and negate the effects with his own Positive Speed Force, but Wally wouldn't let him. Wally led all of Barry's speedster allies into the storm, allowing all of them to surviveIn the wake of the storm, not only did Barry admit to Iris that he was the Flash, but Wally re-introduced himself since his rebirth. Iris immediately recognized him, but their reunion also caused a painful flood of memories to return to Wally.</hero:storyDescription>

Emma was the first person Wolverine contacted when he discovered that reality had been altered by Wanda. Once "reawakened", Emma was able to use her telepathy to restore the memories of others, thereby "reawakening" them as well. After a significant number of heroes, both X-Men and Avengers, had their memories restored, a meeting was held to discuss what should be done regarding the Scarlet Witch. Speaking to this issue, Emma said, "What is there to say? Put her down". Emma was the only one who agreed with Logan - the Scarlet Witch needed to be killed. A large group of X-Men and Avengers traveled to Genosha to deal with the Scarlet Witch. Wanda was driven to the edge, and in this final moment of madness, she uttered the words "No more mutants" deactivating the x-gene of mutants all over the world, thereby significantly decreasing the mutant population from hundreds of thousands to mere hundreds. Emma had been monitoring the battle via Cerebro, and upon the utterance of those words, Emma witnessed thousands of lights representing mutants suddenly go out. She was among the few mutants who still retained their powers after M Day.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> The slightly-cracked, catchphrase-spouting, ever-shameless Deadpool. He's also Faux Affably Evil, loves to make people go What the Hell, Hero?, and is the Trope Codifier of a few other tropes. Note, however, that it seems to depend on the writer. Sometimes he's this with a very large helping of Success Through Insanity, while at other times (particularly in the newer issues) he becomes a Noble Demon who would  Never Hurt an Innocent. As noble as someone who is insane can be anyway. Considering that he's an absolute fruitcake, there is absolutely nothing preventing both those interpretations from being true, depending not so much upon the writer as on the state of Deadpool's brain-pan.</hero:tropeDescription>

Deadpool is kidnapped by a Death Trap enthusiast creatively named Death Trap and chained down underneath a giant teddy bear, which descends lower every time Deadpool speaks and will eventually smother him. Deadpool breaks all his limbs to get out of the trap rather than simply shutting up.

The Flash also can spin his arms to create directed funnels of hurricane speed air that can knock down barriers or reduce the speed of a falling object. When putting out forest fires, what the Flash does when he runs around the perimeter is create a pocket tornado. The updraft lowers the temperature inside the funnel and raises the fire off the ground which takes away its fuel source.</hero:powerDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">With the emergence of a new mutant by the name of Fabio Medina, Cyclops and his X-Men team show up to ascertain him to join the New Charles Xavier Institute for the Gifted. Fabio is being detained by the police at the time of his powers awakening and causing a commotion. The X-Men manage to stop the police but are soon attacked by a group of sentinels. The veteran X-Men manage to defeat the sentinels, even with their altered powers with Cyclops delivering the final blow, leveling the entire area as the group stare in amazement at his power. After the defeated sentinels, the revolutionary group of X-Men leave with Fabio and return the new Xavier Institute. Emma has a break down outside and discovers that she is now projecting her thoughts at random. She has a deep conversation with Scott about their current situation. While they agree they are separated, they show they still care about each other and will continue to work with each other for the betterment of the students. They head inside the new school and go over the current mutant situation. The team teleports to Australia to visit Eva Bell's mother, and not long after showing up, the X-Men and recruits are intercepted by an Avengers squad.Emma and Scott stand up to the Avengers with the bold proclamation that the Avengers are the ones responsible for the death of Charles Xavier. After some statements from Cyclops and the Avengers almost assaulting the X team, Eva Bell freezes them in a temporal bubble. Cyclops makes the statement that the X-Men will protect all the mutants and humans that support them and that a warning to the people who will deny them their freedom has been issued. The X team is transported back to the New Xavier Institute where Magneto is revealed to be the mole. The team shows disgust at the reveal except for Emma, who realizes that Magneto being a double agent is an ingenious plan and even convinces Scott it can play to their advantage. Emma, along with the rest of the veteran mutant team, are transported by Magik to the Jean Grey Institute.When they show up to the Jean Grey Institute, Scott goes off on his explanation of his side in the story and in the meantime, Emma confronts the Stepford Cuckoos where they figure out she does not have her telepathy and realize that is why Emma never made contact. The Cuckoos psychically torture Emma to a degree about it and uncover what happened between her and Scott. Emma doesn't blame them for their actions as she does understand they are just like her. Emma and the Cuckoos then have a psychic conversation about the events happening at the school with the original X-Men coming to the future. The Cuckoos do make mention of Jean Grey and that she is still very untrained, as they have been reading her mind quite frequently. Emma tells the Cuckoos to come with her to the Xavier School where she will continue to train them. Emma and the group leave for a period to return to their school and find the new mutants getting attacked by the Danger Room. It is then that Magik's powers show her broken state as she screams out in pain, briefly disappears, and reappears in a small burst of flames. Emma and the veteran X-Men leave once more for the Jean Grey school and upon their return, the Cuckoos have come to the new Xavier Institute along with the younger version of Angel.After Magik's powers go off again, Cyclops has a talk with her and brings her back. Emma, along with the rest of the team, are forcibly pulled into Limbo where Illyana has transformed into Darkchilde.It is revealed that the team was forcibly transported into Limbo by Dormammu so he could kill the team to spite Magik and eventually kill her. Emma transforms into diamond form to keep herself protected and when Dormammu commands his mindless ones to attack the team, Emma gets the Stepford Cuckoos to turn the fearful new mutant's mindsets into bravery, thus giving them to courage to fight back. Emma and the rest of the team fight the minions to save themselves and Magik.Emma continues battling the mindless ones and the group is soon getting overwhelmed with some getting injured. Magik manages to free herself and cast everyone out while absorbing the entire dimension into herself. One of the students, Benjamin, is nearly dead, but Emma coaches Christopher through the use of his ability and saves him. Scott apologizes to the team and tells them they all must train. Emma and Scott escort Fabio home, as he could not handle the pressure that comes with being an X-man. Emma tells the team not to worry as new mutants are popping up all over the world, and the team rescues and recruits a new mutant by the name of David Bond, who has the ability to control cars. Emma is seen coaching David when he is controlling a massive plane just outside of the compound. When Irma of the Stepford Cuckoos dyes her hair, Emma is seen escorting her back inside when Celeste freaks out on her. Emma helps the team invade the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier when they catch word of Fabio being kidnapped and interrogated and the team manages to successfully save Fabio.Emma and Scott are training the students, but the former couple ends up having a small argument. After watching Eva perform a new ability with her powers, Emma and the rest of the X-Men end up watching a pro-mutant rally in honor of Scott. The X-Men go and join the rally where Emma watches Scott give a speech, but not long after a new sentinel attacks them.The Blockbuster sentinel attacks, and appears to vaporize him. Much to worry about Emma, but due to a timely save from Magik, he is alright. Emma goes diamond and charges the machine, only to be knocked back and caught by Angel. The rest of the X-Men try their luck at attacking it, but the sentinel keeps adapting. Eventually, Magneto arrives and does a final attack. The Sentinel appears to ready to explode, and with Cyclops demanding the robot tell him who sent it, Emma saves Scott before it does leave an explosion, but only due to the assailant calling it back.During a training session, Emma watches as Cyclops is being especially hard on Benjamin for giving up in a training exercise. When Benjamin gets out of the shower, Emma is clad in different clothes and begins to get close to the student in an attempt to make him uncomfortable and push him to get his powers to activate. The attempt works as Emma picks up on his traits and comes to the conclusion that he is more than just a shape-shifter, and that he can mess with technology, and that he releases a pheromone of sorts that makes people feel good about themselves. Emma and Magik take him to Atlanta, Georgia where they put his powers to the test. Emma ends up having the student run an actual mission. She hands him a letter and tells Benjamin to bring it all the way up to Timothy Dugan's office with a note telling him that in someone inside SHIELD is attacking mutants. Benjamin ends up passing and Emma tells Scott about his successful mission.</hero:storyDescription>

He remarks about how Wolverine only wants him so he can be the "token human" of the team. This Deadpool makes several pop culture references just like earth 616 does. Wolverine beings to question his decision to extend an invitation but after Deadpool single-handedly takes down several assassins he knows he made the right choice. While training however Agent Zero again tracks them down and Deadpool is apparently killed when he melts into sort of goop after Agent Zero attacks him with a corrosive weapon that has an attribute that works best against those with a healing factor.</hero:alternateVersions>

His Cloudcuckoolander tendencies and ability to both shake off bodily harm and make a joke of it tend to obscure the fact that he is an immortal, unstoppable, superhuman killing-machine with a penchant for inventively torturing and/or brutally slaughtering anyone who manages to get on his bad side. In the Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe miniseries, he singlehandedly slaughters nearly every superhero and villain on the planet. This is caused when Psycho-Man fiddled with Deadpool's brain until something clicked, turning him into the perfect killing machine with a penchant for nihilism. He resolves to destroy reality itself, believing that it never mattered anyway, due to him being aware that he is a comic book character. This is proof that he isn't just capable of fighting A-list Marvel heroes and villains, he is capable of murdering every single one with ease.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool got Wolverine's healing factor from the same place Wolverine got his adamantium skeleton, but since he had cancer before getting it, his healing factor caused the tumors to grow out of control and made him horribly scarred and insane (he thinks he's a character in a comic book). He has noted that he couldn't come back from the silly lengths that Wolverine has managed — although he can regrow fast enough that his friend Cable would psychically make his head explode for a joke. Deadpool's blown himself up and then been dragged back to the X-Men Mansion by Colossus in a sack of body parts, complaining all the way. He's been liquefied and drunk by Cable. And he's decapitated on a fairly regular basis. During the Secret Invasion, Deadpool actually weaponized his healing factor by letting the Skrulls use it to make their next generation of Super Skrulls. We then find out that if it wasn't for Deadpool's deadly cancer constantly killing him, his healing factor would be completely out of control. The Super Skrulls keep generating more and more body mass until they explode. Deadpool's daughter Ellie has a variation. After death, her body "reboots" back into the age when her mutant ability first emerged, with her memories intact.</hero:tropeDescription>
    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Part of his package of "combat enhancements" is a high-end healing ability. He mentions during Millar's run that his immune system "is as deadly as every other part of my body," allowing him to recover completely from even chronic diseases over the course of several weeks, and in The Magnificent Kevin, he goes from immobile to walking under his own power in an hour once his powers are back on. In Midnighter and Apollo he channeled the power of an angel for long enough that it should have burned out his body and killed him, as he was warned by the sorceror who bound that angel to him. Not only does he survive (albeit unable to stand and needing Apollo to carry him to safety), but he seems perfectly fine just a few days later.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> In their early appearances together, Deadpool is violent and possessive towards his ex-girlfriend, Vanessa Carlylse. In X-Force, Deadpool acts as Mr. Tolliver's enforcer when Vanessa poses as Domino to infiltrate Cable's X-Force team. Deadpool beats her as a warning to remember the job and not fall for Cable. When Cable and Vanessa-as-Domino come across the real imprisoned Domino, Deadpool sneaks up behind Vanessa and stabs her in the back. Vanessa stays on the run, but Deadpool keeps tracking her down and threatening her. He's on her trail in Wolverine and refers to her as "my ex-squeeze" when fighting Wolverine. When he finds Vanessa and her new boyfriend note Garrison Kane, who was in the Weapon X program with Deadpool, Deadpool accuses him of "stealing my girl". Vanessa points out the possessive language and fights back as Deadpool tries to kill them both. Wolverine arrives just in time to save her from getting Deadpool's thrown katana in her heart.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma had been teaching on the mutant island kingdom of Genosha when Cassandra Nova launched a massive sentinel attack. The attack wiped out the population of the island. Jean Grey and Hank McCoy traveled to Genosha to help with relief efforts and discovered only one survivor - Emma Frost. She'd been saved by the manifestation of her secondary mutation, a flexible, organic diamond form. In her arms, she held the corpse of her former student, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, unwilling to accept that she'd died. Emma was taken back to the Xavier Institute so that Beast could run a few tests on her new mutation. He concluded that she'd been gifted with diamond skin. Unfortunately, when in diamond form, Emma discovered that she could no longer access her telepathy. In this form, she could not experience genuine emotion or pain. After telepathically summoning a taxi, Emma planned to leave the Institute, but she said she had an "epiphany", and decided to stop the car and head back to the school. She entered as the other X-Men were battling Cassandra Nova. In her diamond form, Emma twisted Nova's neck, killing her, saying that "There are just some things that shouldn't be forgiven." However, Nova had a type of healing factor that kicked in and brought her back. Unbeknownst to the X-Men, Nova had switched places with Xavier by means of a consciousness transfer. Nova now occupied the body of Xavier. As Xavier, she shot her own true body to cripple the real Charles. Cyclops thanks Emma for coming back. Emma plays this off, saying that she'd forgotten her bag, and it was lucky for Scott that it was a Louis Vitton. After this event, Emma decides to join the X-Men.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Wade Wilson is a man shrouded in mystery. For instance: Wade Wilson may not be his real name and his back story may have been stolen (in-continuity) from another character. He remembers a mother who died of cancer when he was five, another mother who beat him during his teen years. He remembers a father who abandoned him in his childhood-years and yet another father who died in a bar room altercation when he was 17. That father was a good man but a military man whom was very strict with Wade, to whom Wade rebelled. He was shot by one of Wade's friends, which caused Wade to be filled with remorse. The final father is the only one who is definitely real, all the other snatches and fragments of memories may be the result of his broken psyche. It is later revealed that the various conflicting memories of his family were implanted by a man named Butler, and that Deadpool had actually been forced to kill his own family while under Butler's control.He remembers an upbringing in Ohio, but even he recognizes that this may not be true. This mysterious young man joined and quickly excelled in military service, or at least the combat side of service. The strict hierarchy and rules didn't jibe with the young man's sense of self and his absolute need to rebel against authority figures, clearly military life was not for him and he was dishonorably discharged. The military did teach him two things: he was good at killing and he enjoyed it, so he quickly found work as a mercenary, though at first he only took on targets who he felt deserved to die.Eventually he wound up in Japan as a Yakuza enforcer where he fell in love with one of the boss' daughters. The young man's mind was already in a state of radical instability, though, and he knew the relationship could never be, so he returned to America and ditched his previous moral code in addition to changing his entire identity, even his appearance, after each failed mission, fracturing his mind even more severely.When an ordinary couple stumbled upon the wounded mercenary in the woods, they took him into their home. The woman even nurses him back to health but again his unstable mind strikes, and he becomes enamored with the young woman and envious of her life with her husband. So he burns their house down and kills her husband before accidentally killing her too. He takes the name Wade Wilson and believes himself to be the dead woman's husband, but still returns to the mercenary trade. It was later found out in the Cable/Deadpool series, that this story was a lie and that Deadpool is the real Wade Wilson.It's at this stage in his life that he meets the shape-shifting prostitute Vanessa Carlysle. The young couple quickly fall in love, both of them tainted by pasts they'd rather forget. Wilson's possibly idyllic life is shattered, however, when he contracts cancer and leaves Vanessa because he doesn't want to burden her with his failing health.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma gained a secondary mutation during the destruction of Genosha, which manifested as complete transmutation of her organic tissues into a diamond-like substance. It was later revealed in a flashback that Cassandra Nova possibly catalyzed Emma's secondary mutation in order to allow her to survive the harsh environment of Genosha (however, it is still questionable if this is really true). This ability allows Emma to turn into an un-living yet sentient and mobile diamond form, granting her extreme resistance to damage, invulnerability to cold and heat, enhanced speed, super strength (no limit has been clearly defined but handbooks say approximately 2 tons), immortality, and limitless stamina as her body does not tire or produce any fatigue toxins while in this form. She also does not feel pain or emotions and has no need to eat, sleep, or drink while in diamond form. A drawback of her diamond form is she can not access her telepathy, but in return, it grants her telepathic immunity to all but a few telepaths. Emma can stay transformed for as long as she likes, and the speed it takes for her to transform in and out of her diamond form is almost instantaneous, being described as happening within a hundredth of a second.Emma's diamond form has stood up to Cyclops' optic blasts, jet crashes, blasts from Bishop, hits from World War Hulk, the collapse of Genosha, a blast from Black Bolt, and even a blast from the Dreaming Celestial's head when it was taken over by Mr. Sinister. Emma can be broken if hit with the appropriate amount of force, appropriate weapon and her shatter point (believed to be somewhere on her forehead). Her first instance of entirely shattering was due to a diamond bullet hitting her in her shatter point at extremely high speeds. In her second instance of breaking (this did not involve her shatter point), Emma's arm was cut off when attacked by one of the Dreaming Celestial's "mini celestial" probes its body broke into. Despite her arm breaking off, this shows an impressive upper limit to the kind of damage her diamond form can take, considering one of them was able to blast a massive hole in Colossus' chest and send him flying across San Francisco.</hero:powerDescription>

Wade couldn't help but annoy Red into attacking him. While Omega Red took on the traffickers, a defenseless Wade was eaten by a polar bear, only to be found partially digested by Kraven the Hunter. While still assembling himself, Wade is interrogated by Kraven and spills the beans that he has special gate privileges despite his lack of an X-gene. This inspires Kraven to turn him into an organic key.Once they were on the island, Kraven discards Deadpool's remain to hunt other mutants. Now that they have the resurrection protocols, Kraven sees them as the new apex predator, perfect for a challenge. Under orders from Beast, Black Tom went in search of Deadpool, who would be needed to fight off Kraven. Not willing to wait for Deadpool's body to grow back, Black Tom created a telefloronic one for Wade to use in the meantime.Unfortunately, this new vegetable body was unable to withstand the lifelike volcanic activity in The Shadow Room, X-Force's personal Danger Room, where Kraven made his stand. Wolverine refused his chance to kill Kraven, seeing no honor in it, and retreated rescuing Wade in the process.</hero:storyDescription>

He recognises that Jesse appears to have very few friends outside of her employees so he invites her onto the Titans and brings her to sporting events with Linda so she has something of a social life.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Wally West is very different from Barry Allen, despite attempts to make Barry resemble Wally since. While Barry is a straight-laced Science Hero, Wally was a hot-headed Deadpan Snarker Determinator, and while Barry mostly worked alone outside of Wally, Wally himself would surround himself with companions. In a lot of ways, Barry was very much a 'super-cop', approaching the situation like it was a case and arresting the bad guys, while Wally was more a 'super-social worker', prefers Befriending the Enemy and solving the reasons behind their crimes than just fight themnote note that Barry actually was a cop in his day job while Wally, who operated with an open identity, treated superheroics as a career, but various AU stories showed he'd likely become a teacher if he didn't become a superhero. There's also that Barry was vocally very conservative in his political views and butted heads with Green Arrow over it, while Wally, by the time he was the Flash, was a centrist who ended up moving to the left thanks to his friendship with the socialist liberal Pied Piper influencing his views.</hero:tropeDescription>

Both she and Batman expressed the intention for her to eventually replace him as Gotham's protector, which would make her a disabled non-white woman taking the place of a neurotypical white man (though it's debatable how neurotypical Bruce Wayne is).

More shockingly, when Barry tries to stop Wally, Wally threatens to cripple Barry. Mind you, Wally practically worships the ground Barry walks on, and he just threatened him just to save his kids. The fact their current state was largely Barry's fault thanks to Flashpoint probably didn't help.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool is known as the famous Merc with the Mouth, one of Marvel's most popular characters, with his movie franchise being even more successful than the X-Men themselves. With his massive following, merchandise, sales and surrounding culture, it might be hard to believe that when he was introduced, he was not the famous Anti-Hero we know him for, but rather a villain. Furthermore, Rob Liefeld created him as nothing more than a Captain Ersatz of Deathstroke, being a run of the mill Gun And Sword-wielding Super-Soldier mercenary who tangled with the New Mutants and had practically none of the personality we know him for now. It was when other writers like Joe Kelly began diversifying his characterization that he became as popular as he is today. Back then, no one could've expected how popular Deadpool would've ended up being, considering he's now bigger than all the New Mutants put together. Even Cable himself, who was intended from the start to be a big deal to the X-Men franchise and ended up as an even bigger deal than Liefeld ever imagined, ultimately got eclipsed by Deadpool's popularity. The 2004 Cable &amp; Deadpool series started out with Cable as the lead character and Deadpool as his sidekick, but by 2008 it was Deadpool who was the undisputed main character, and the book was cancelled in favor of a new Deadpool solo book.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma Frost is a playable character in X-Men Legends. She is unlocked as a Non-Playable character (NPC) after the Nuclear Power plant level where you save Colossus. She only becomes playable after Alison speaks with her and Charles Xavier at the Mansion. The depiction of Emma in this game is quite faithful to her comic book counterpart, aside from her attraction to Professor X rather than Cyclops. Her active powers in the game are: Confuse, Fear, Psychic Shell and Psychic Bedlam. She is voiced by Bobby Holliday.</hero:mediaDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool is known for being able to see through the fourth wall and snap it in two if he wants to. The reasoning is because he's a very special kind of insane, which occasionally allows him to perceive things others cannot. From being able to see the yellow boxes that he thinks in, to referring to the last time he showed up by issue number, Deadpool's odd observations are even occasionally plot points; for example, Deadpool is unaffected by Marvel's recent massive retcon of the past twenty years of Spider-Man's history, leaving some fans to speculate it was put there as an editorial escape plan if necessary. Fabian Nicieza usually makes a recap page that isn't in continuity, which means that blobs like the Blob can break the fourth wall at will during the recap page. One Cable &amp; Deadpool recap page had Cable hinting to Deadpool that he has infected Deadpool with subliminal messages. Since this recap page wasn't in continuity, Deadpool didn't know about the meeting, which didn't stop him from, in the story, saying these words</hero:tropeDescription>

When it's all said and done, Bullseye has admitted that Deadpool is the only person he likes. He even attended Deadpool's (not-permanent) funeral and mourned him in secret.

Not much is known about the game bar for the fact it is based on Diablo's core gameplay aspects.The MMO's story is being written by Brian Michael Bendis.Her bio says:For most of her life, Emma Frost thought only of her own needs and goals, seeing humanity as inferior to her own mutant race. She used her intelligence, charm, and telepathic powers to accumulate great wealth. Soon she joined the mysterious Hellfire Club, a group secretly dedicated to world domination. For years she helped that group gain the political and economic influence it desired, often clashing with the X-Men.Over time, however, Emma came to see the teaching of young mutants as her true calling. Eventually she allied with Professor Charles Xavier and her former enemies, becoming a full-fledged member of the X-Men and a teacher at the Xavier School.She was released in several costumes.She is voiced by Kari Wahlgren.</hero:mediaDescription>

After being left for dead by "Barry" during "The Return of Barry Allen", Wally also briefly considered retiring.

Wilson built up his reputation working with the mechanized man Garrison Kane, fellow mercenary Sluggo and the suspicious Greg Teraerton. When Teraerton began to exhibit psychotic tendencies, Wilson killed him and was kicked out of Department H. He was sent to a facility called the Hospice and within that facility came under the dubious care of Dr. Ermys Killbrew's "workshop", a place for failed experiments. After being experimented upon multiple times, Wade is repeatedly visited by a hooded woman who comforts him and, after multiple visits, he falls in love with her. However the woman, it turns out, is the physical embodiment of Death, who Wade sees and can communicate with because he's so close to dying.Wanting to join Death he began taunting and defying his guards, hoping they would have him killed, but all the lead guard Ajax did was gladly sent him in for more of Killbrew's excruciating tests. The guards began to bet on when patients would die next and threw their money into a 'dead pool', the winner of which would win the pot. To Ajax and Wade's dismay, he continued to survive and Ajax wasn't authorized to kill a patient unless that patient had killed another. When Wade finally attacks Ajax, the guard responds with incredible brutality, but accidentally triggers Wilson's healing factor, allowing the mercenary to escape with a few of his fellow inmates. He mockingly dubbed himself 'Deadpool' and went back to his mercenary lifestyle. Sometime later, it is revealed Deadpool has become a father.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Wally is voiced by Michael Rosenbaum (Smallville's Lex Luthor). The importance of the Flash as the "heart" of the Justice League was shown in the episode "A Better World", when his death in an alternate timeline triggered a series of events which turned that alternate League (the "Justice Lords") into virtual dictators of Earth. He has also proven key in saving the day in a few episodes, such as Divided We Fall, in which he tapped into a new level of power to defeat the fused Brainiac/ Lex Luthor when all the other six founding Justice League members could not. In the process, he was drawn into the Speed Force, and barely managed to escape. The episode "Flash and Substance" is centered on the opening of the Flash Museum on "Flash Appreciation Day" in Central City, and featured many of the Flash's rogues in cameos, while focusing on Captain Boomerang, Mirror Master, Captain Cold, and The Trickster (voiced by Mark Hamill). Linda Park also appears as a reporter covering the museum opening. Mirror Master alludes that Wally West may not have been the only Flash stating to the rest of the Rogues, "We've all been stopped by a Flash. Additionally, the episode "The Great Brain Robbery", saw The Flash and Lex Luthor inadvertently changing consciousness-Wally West (inside Lex Luthor's body) is tasked with trying to figure out what has occurred, escape, and not be killed by the suspicious members of the Legion of Doom.Wally West is the Flash featured as one of the seven founding members of the Justice League, in both the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited animated series. His personality is more or less the same as it was from his appearance on Superman: The Animated Series, and his flippant attitude is often used to provide comic relief from the often intense nature of his fellow Leaguers, though he is the featured hero in several episodes. However, in one episode of Justice League Unlimited, he complains to Elongated Man that he dislikes being viewed as the "teenage sidekick" even though he was part of the original seven. His super fast metabolism, which results in him eating absurdly and inhumanly large portions of food, was something of a running gag on the series.Wally elements of the JL/JLU animated Flash, he has red hair and green eyes like Wally does in the comics. This Flash also has Wally's girl-crazed, occasionally big-headed manner, paired with a childlike attitude and intelligence. When he tries to vibrate his molecules through solid objects, he causes them to explode as opposed to passing through the object intangible like Barry Allen would. Linda Park, Wally's girlfriend and eventual wife in the comics, appears in an episode and is a suggested love interest for the Flash. He also has a good relationship with Hawkgirl. Wally shows a strong friendship with Shayera that is touched on several times through both the JL and JLU series, usually in a sisterly way, including him being the first to hug her after her decision to resign. In the Justice League Unlimited third season's debut episode "I Am Legion", Flash says, "She loves me. She's like the big sister I never had. Only, you know short."Wally appears without the Flash costume twice in the series. The first time is in the Starcrossed episodes when the Justice League decides to remove their costumes and move around as ordinary people to hide and regroup. The Flash appears reluctant to trust his fellow Justice League members with his secret identity, whereupon Batman shows he already knows by exclaiming, "Wally West!" while pointing at the Flash, followed up by revealing the secret identity of Superman (Clark Kent) and himself (Bruce Wayne). Wally then removes his mask and Wonder Woman tells him that she likes his red hair just before ruffling it. The second time is in the episode "Flash and Substance", where Wally is shown to be working at the forensics lab before taking a half day off to attend the Flash museum opening. Wally's face is also exposed in one other episode, "The Great Brain Robbery". When his mind is switched with Lex Luthor's, Lex removes the mask to see if he can at least "figure out" who the Flash really is by looking at his face in the bathroom mirror, only to state in an annoyed tone, "I have no idea who this is.'</hero:mediaDescription>

After they stopped laughing, Emma offered Toad her particular house so he can recover without further humiliation. The interesting part is that this happened when Emma was White Queen and a true villainess, so sparing The Grotesque in this period truly applies for the trope. After faking Cyclops's death to make him into more of an idea than a man(Scott was actually already dead) she tells Havok the real circumstances, feeling he has a right to know as Scott's brother.

    <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma appears as one of the main characters in the series, voiced by Kari Wahlgren.Uninvited, Emma Frost first appears at the mansion's front door seeking to join the X-Men. Wolverine refuses her, but is eventually forced to accept her into the team since she is the only telepath available and therefore the only one able to operate Cerebro. She successfully located Charles Xavier's lifeless body in the heart of Magneto's Genosha, but later attempts to locate Jean Grey were less successful. In an effort to remain on the team she informs Cyclops that 'given time I could locate her, but if [Wolverine] has his way I'll be gone tomorrow'. Frost is intelligent and tactical, and is an extremely powerful telepath. Her first telepathic fight as an X-Man was against the Shadow King. Storm had been manipulated into believing that Africa was burning and used her mutant powers to put the fires out. However, in reality she was tearing the country apart with rain storms and tornadoes.It was Emma's telepathic powers that saved Storm's life, the whole continent of Africa, and eventually defeat the Shadow King. Later on she was able to disable Psylocke's telepathic attacks with relative ease. Despite Wolverine's initial distrust of Frost, he has grown to accept her as a permanent member of the team.Her battle against the Shadow King and her success to mend some of Wolverine's memories of his time in Weapon X have earned his respect. However, she is extremely secretive and on one occasion lied to Wolverine about Forge's availability. She also appears to be fond of Cyclops, often watching him from afar. Cyclops is still depressed for the loss of Jean Grey. Emma offered to delete his memories of Jean and make him normal again.Emma betrays the X-Men after Jean is found. It is revealed that she has been working for the Inner Circle in an attempt to destroy the Phoenix Force. The Inner Circle then double crosses Emma and tries to use the Phoenix for their own ends. It, however proves too powerful for them to control. When the Phoenix Force is released and is searching for Jean, Emma traps it in her body, transforms into diamond and projects it into the atmosphere where it cannot find a host. She manages to ask Cyclops to forgive her before shattering and seemingly dies.X-Men (2012)In the Japanese X-Men anime, Emma is found to by the Astonishing X-Men (Beast, Cyclops, Logan and Storm) in a pod next to Armor in the U-Men Lab. It is revealed that Emma was kidnapped by the U-Men while searching for Hisako, her missing student. After copping the blame for forcing Jean Grey to commit suicide as Dark Phoenix, Emma joins the X-Men as to continue her tutelage of Armor. She even goes as far as allowing Xavier to view her mind and broadcast her life to the X-Men to gain Cyclops' trust.As the series goes on she is shown to care for younger mutants and enjoys teaching the next generation, a more motherly aspect - but still retains her ever-observant and cunning personality.Whilst Emma is shown to use both her Telepathy and Diamond Form, she lacks any of the hand-to-hand combat training and relies heavily on her Diamond Form to take a more defensive position in the team. She is voiced by Kaori Yamagata in the Japanese version, and by Ali Hillis in the English dub.</hero:mediaDescription>

However, a fight breaks out, and it is revealed Midnighter had other things in mind. It turns out that Midnighter used to call London his home and served as it's protector. A nearby apartment building was a hotspot for strange happenings, which he was never able to resolve, and he came back to check up on things. This recent fight is just the most recent in a long line of disturbing and violent occurences in the building, including murder, rape, and torture. He and Apollo suit up to get to the bottom of things, and come across a boy named Lazarus scrawling pictures of demons on the walls using his parent's blood. As they enter the room, the boy, apparently unable to hold it back any longer, calls forth the demon Etrigan. Turns out he had been buried under the building, and it was his influence causing all the violence in the area. Midnighter attacks Etrigan, thinking he can take him while he's still weak, but Etrigan knocks him out with one punch. Apollo, thinking Midnighter dead, angrily attacks Etrigan, until the rest of Stormwatch shows up. Midnighter gets up, not dead after all, and joins in the attack, until they are able to drive Etrigan off. Apollo and Midnighter happily reunite after the fight is over, only to have the Engineer announce that a new rule is going into effect forbidding any romantic relationships between members. Apollo and Midnighter decide later to ignore the rule. Apollo suggests leaving Stormwatch together, but Midnighter declines, saying he feels he's found a home with Stormwatch and that he feels he needs the structure they provide.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma was with the team when they visited Cooperstown, Alaska to find the newborn Hope Summers. They searched for survivors as they looked upon the carnage that the Marauders and the Purifiers had left in their wake. Emma used her telepathy to scan for survivors. The baby Hope was missing, and the X-Men believed Mr. Sinister's Marauders had taken her. In an effort to find her, a team of five - Wolverine, Storm, Nightcrawler, Colossus, &amp; Angel - was dispatched to confront the Marauders. Sinister, believing that taking down the team would be simple, was surprised to find that there was a sixth X-Man with them: though her body was back at the mansion, Emma was psychically present, shielding the minds of the X-Men against Sinister's telepathy. When the Sentinels that stood guard over the school were hijacked by Bishop (unbeknownst to the team), Emma's concentration was broken, and the team became susceptible to Sinister's attacks. Emma was also with the team later on when they battled the Marauders and took down Harpoon. During the battle on Muir Island, Emma psychically engaged Exodus, and the two battled telepathically. Though Exodus was capable of other feats (telekinesis, etc.), Emma was able to keep him so completely focused on their psi-battle that he was unable to use his other abilities on her. While Emma kept him distracted, Dust entered his body one grain of sand at a time, and scoured his lungs, incapacitating the mutant, while the rest of the X-Men finished off the remaining Marauders.</hero:storyDescription>

This is connected to the fact that for Deadpool, there is No Fourth Wall. Indeed, the Deadpool comics became so famous for this that the dual sublines for the comic were "The Merc with a Mouth" and "Breaking down the fourth wall one brick at a time!" Earlier Deadpool books toyed with this; he didn't actually have any proof that he was in a comic book (because, let's face it, he can't perceive the reader no matter how much he tries to look outside the page) but kept up the act anyway because he believed it was true (and it was funny). This detail has since been dropped for simplicity. At one point, numerous characters tell him he is saying aloud everything that was in the yellow boxes, which leads him to suspect his "internal monologue" is broken. No one listens or responds to what he says, because he is known to be completely insane. This gag has extended to other media including Deadpool</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Even though he is a Hot-Blooded Deadpan Snarker in comics, his fame as the "Fun Personified Flash" comes mainly from the DCAU version. It also helped that Kyle Rayner (who is more inexperienced than him) wasn't in the cartoons as a JL member and Wally was paired with the more serious John Stewart instead. His personality in the popular series influenced all speedster characters, such as Quicksilver from the X-Men movies and his mentor Barry Allen's modern interpretations.</hero:tropeDescription>

He's pretty much the most hated student in the school because of his personality. Kidpool was sent to the Danger Room (detention) with Cyclops because Kidpool gave Cyclops a wedgie and also Xavier wanted to prevent Kidpool from ruining a social with a girl school. Kidpool convinced Cyclops to escape the danger room and went to the social. When Cyclops saw Jean Grey dancing with Wolverine, Cyclops hired Kidpool to cause a distraction while Cyclops grabbed Jean away. After a distraction and a fight with a couple kid mutants Earth 616 Deadpool came in and took Kidpool away and had him joined Deadpool corps. Kidpool is now known as Tito by the rest of the Corps.</hero:alternateVersions>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Various details of Deadpool's early life and family upbringing aren't compatible. He's an American born in Ohio or a Canadian born in Canada. He was raised by an asshole single mother without knowing who his father was, by both parents until his father walked out, by his asshole father after his mother died of cancer and until a punk friend shot his father dead, or by two parents who lived into adulthood until Deadpool was tricked into carrying out a hit on them. Other life experiences before becoming Deadpool or directly leading into it are told in incompatible ways. In the Twist Ending of Joe Kelly's run, Arch-Enemy T-Ray claims Deadpool was once named Jack and the real Wade was a teacher who married his high school sweetheart, Mercedes. Mercedes and Wade rescued "the monster" Jack from a frozen river, Jack wanted to change his identity into Wade's and grew obsessed with Mercedes, but accidentally killed Mercedes when disposing of Wade. This supposedly broke Deadpool's mind and confused his identity into thinking he was Wade, while the actual Wade returned to life as T-Ray. Near the end of Frank Tieri's run, Deadpool and T-Ray clash again and Deadpool seemingly kills T-Ray after getting reason to believe T-Ray's claims were all lies. The storyline returns in Cable &amp; Deadpool by Deadpool co-creator Fabian Nicieza, with an Armed with Canon fourth wall break dismissing the twist.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> As Deadpool features a lot of both meta-commentary and time travel, this tends to come up in his book. The best example is when he gets set into the past to Amazing Spider-Man #47, and infiltrates himself into the story, Forrest Gump style.note Deadpool vol 3 #11 All the panels and dialogue are drawn in John Romita's style, and all the characters (except Deadpool and friends) talk like Stan Lee wrote them. (Indeed, enough panels are lifted from the original work that Romita and Lee are credited as co-authors.) In case you're wondering why specifically Spider-Man, it's because Deadpool's costume bears no small resemblance to that of the ol' Webhead, meaning it was a snap to redraw Spidey as 'Pool. Deadpool vol 5 #7 (from the Duggan and Posehn run) is supposedly an inventory story from 1979, crossing Deadpool (who, of course, didn't exist at the time to write inventory stories about) into the Iron Man "Demon in a Bottle" storyline, with 70s Spidey and the Power Pack also making appearances. The art and writing style both reflect this, and it even has oversaturated Bronze Age colouring. Later issues in that run follow on from this, having Deadpool show up in what are claimed to be inventory stories from other eras, with the writing and art in the style of those periods. Including one from Deadpool's actual early days, with a Rob Liefeld in-joke as the characters have everything possible hiding their feet.</hero:tropeDescription>

Later, zombie Deadpool is the first to be sent into the 616 universe and infects some of the members of the Florida initiative as part of an invasion plan, but is decapitated and his still living head is brought back for study at A.R.M.O.R. headquarters. He tagged along Simon Garth until he sailed to the Savage Land where he meets his 616 counterpart. This Deadpool seems almost identical to earth 616's. He is sarcastic, states he had a healing factor before getting infected but it doesn't work anymore, and has 616 Deadpool's sadistic sense of humor. He also breaks the fourth wall just like Earth 616 Deadpool does. This version of Deadpool is now a member of the Deadpool Corps. headpool has also been in shorts made by a low youtuber who made a perfect deadpool costume.</hero:alternateVersions>

The game is an extremely loyal adaptation of the comics and the general style of writing for the character.</hero:mediaDescription>

He forces Wallace to think on his feet and supports him while he comes up with solutions, as opposed to spoon feeding him any. While it's clear Wally could solve problems himself, he gives Ace the chance to try things out himself. It's actually a more positive experience for Wallace than his mentorship under Barry, which in contrast to Wally, didn't involve as much trust.</hero:tropeDescription>

Even though her upbringing was a neverending training from hell, she did love her father, and yet she ran away from him. The reason was that her first kill was the very first time she had witnessed death up close and due to her body-reading abilities, she thought it to be very, very, scary. Thus she found out her upbringing was evil. Now enter the last issue of Adam Beechen's miniseries about her where it is revealed that she hated her dad all along, and that she had actually witnessed her father committing murder up close many times before her first kill. Her post-Flashpoint origin changes up a number of things</hero:tropeDescription>
    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool was retroactively added to the Weapon X program; he is not present in Weapon X stories published before his first appearance. In issue #34 of Vol. 3, Deadpool's Arch-Enemy T-Ray reveals that Deadpool is not actually Wade Wilson, but stole the identity from the man who would become T-Ray. T-Ray claims the "real" Wade was a teacher, unlike the monstrous mercenary "Jack" who became Deadpool. This clashed with Deadpool's previous Weapon X origin written by the same writer. A different writer in same series retconned the retcon with a ham-handed explanation that T-Ray was tricking Deadpool to mess with his head; the Weapon X story and the name Wade Wilson became his origin again. Most fans didn't even remember this mess until T-Ray's version was restated as false in Cable &amp; Deadpool, written by Deadpool co-creator Fabian Nicieza. Deadpool was added to Secret Wars with his own miniseries, Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars.</hero:tropeDescription>

Shatterstar is one of the best swordsmen in the entire Marvel Universe, and quite skilled at all other forms of close-range combat to boot.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma is a powerful and experienced telepath. Her psionic powers allow her to perform several feats such as mental communication, mind reading, mind control, induce paralysis, possession, hypnosis, pain stimulation, illusion casting, astral projection, psychic surgery, and by collecting ambient psionic energy she can create powerful psionic lightning bolts or "psi-bolts", that can attack on a physical or mental level and are capable of rendering a person unconscious or even killing them. Emma's telepathy is powerful enough to communicate and affect people all the way across the planet. She has even done a mental broadcasting of Cyclops' own thoughts to all of the remaining mutants that were left on the Earth. Emma has also displayed psychometric powers, having taught a class of young mutants how to do so, as well. Using her telepathy, she can also psionically shut off another's mutant's telepathy.Emma has been stated to be an "Omega Class Telepath" (the same classification as Charles Xavier), a level 10 psi and one of the top five telepaths on Earth. Emma's telepathy manifested itself in her teens, and she has devoted her life to mastering her many psychic skills. For a period following the death of Jean Grey and the de-powering of Professor Xavier (though he has since regained his abilities), Emma has acted as the X-Men's primary telepath.After utilizing and losing the Phoenix Force post-Avengers vs X-Men, Emma's powers have been altered with her losing most of her telepathy as result. Another side effect of the Phoenix Force altering her powers, Emma now projects her thoughts unto people at random intervals with no control over this change.Despite the initial loss of her telepathy, for awhile Emma only had a modicum of her previous power levels. Emma is still one of the most skilled telepaths on Marvel Earth. In place of her shattered telepathy, she was relying upon on the powers of other telepaths to which she uses her own mind as a conduit for, such as the Stepford Cuckoos' or the young Jean Grey's telepathic powers. This enables her to engage in telepathic battles and make full use of her skill since the younger mutants do not possess the knowledge she does. Emma recently revealed that her broken telepathic powers have been repaired and back at her normal levels due to training with the Stepford Cuckoos.Her power levels have increased to the point where she was able to create and sustain a projection of Cyclops for an extended period of time. She was able to project her thoughts to the entire world, with the aid of the Cuckoos. This projection of Cyclops was even caught on camera, suggesting that Emma's illusions are not just in the mind of her targets.</hero:powerDescription>

Deadpool shows his affection by spelling out messages with Alex's entrails, and also stealing his pancreas just because he can. Deadpool has jumped face first into concrete from a 10 story building to try to "fix" looking like Tom Cruise. That's Thom Cruz. Deadpool has also jumped into a malfunctioning nuclear reactor to stop it from going nuclear. In Cable &amp; Deadpool, Cable's preferred method of getting Deadpool to leave him alone, at least at first, is to telekinetically blow up his brain, resulting in a nasty-looking head wound and Deadpool being down for about an hour.</hero:tropeDescription>

Emma traveled with the survivors to the Savage Land and found a secret bunker set up by Nick Fury, who met them there. Emma was unable to pick up any psychic signatures in the Savage Land, but Ka-Zar was present there. She was also unable to penetrate the walls of the bunker.

Harry appears on the Eye of the Storm disguised as a Shadow Lord, and tells Stormwatch that they are to take a more proactive approach to the superbeings on Earth, and tells them to kill Superman, Batman, and Green Lantern, saying they are "a threat" presumably in the hopes that Stormwatch will kill themselves in the attempt, or at least weaken them. The Projectionist also makes a return, and it is revealed that Harry has somehow implanted a false memory in her mind of him dying in an explosion, and plotting against Stormwatch with Midnighter. Midnighter sees through Harry's disguise, and tells the others that Harry is trying to trick them, but to no avail. Harry tells them to arrest Midnighter, who abducts Projectionist and heads out a Door into Antarctica in an effort to uncover evidence that Harry is the 'Shadow Lord'. While tracking Midnighter, he kills several researchers, which he uses to frame Midnighter for murder, and convince Stormwatch that he needs to be killed.</hero:storyDescription>

Later, in her early time as Batgirl, she was extremely technically proficient in combat but inexperienced in the field and had trouble facing metahumans and genuine supervillains. Her general solution to any problem was hitting people, which sometimes led to unfortunate consequences. It took some hard lessons for her to be more flexible and clever on the job.</hero:tropeDescription>

Instead, she became a excellent teacher doing genuinely good actions while feeling good about it. However, later in Generation X, she was strongly hinted to have murdered a police officer looking into her sister's death (at Emma's hands). Grant Morrison and some other writers returned her closer to her roots again, according to some it made her more interesting, but played her as a complete hedonistic Jerkass, which sat badly with those who were introduced to her through Generation X, because it put all the Character Development she had during seven years in a trash bin. Later other writers attempted to either return her to the less extreme portrayal or attempt to integrate the two. How villainous she is post-Inhumans vs. X-Men tends to vary wildly. One comic might portray her as a genocidal lunatic, and the next she'll be palling around with Iceman or flirting with Jessica Jones.</hero:tropeDescription>

Then Dr. Killebrew experiments on and tortures him to the point of having visions of (and falling in love with) Death. What finally demolishes his sanity is when Killebrew orders him killed, his healing factor finally kicks in, saving his life, making his disfigurement permanent, and causing Death to reject him. Depending on the writer, he's a mix of Ax-Crazy, Deadpan Snarker, gleeful Genre Savvy, and Medium Awareness. Another issue is that the Healing Factor is connected to his cancer — he's basically an immortal living cancer. The constant state of flux and strain this places on him (including his brain) is why he's so unstable.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">On Christmas Eve, Wally and Linda enjoyed a get together at Jay Garrick's house, with Jay and his wife Joan. As someone knocks on the door, everybody is shocked to see Barry Allen alive and saying hi.A week later, Jay and Hal Jordan (the Green Lantern) visited Barry. According to him, Barry came back into his human form during Wally's fight with Doctor Alchemy. He could not remember who he is until he visited Flash Museum and stole one of the older Flash costumes he found there and the next thing he did was found Jay and Wally. While Wally is very skeptical about Barry's return, according to Hal's ring, Barry is telling the truth.As Barry saw his old enemy, Pied Piper, Barry attacked him in an extremely aggressive and unusual behavior for Barry. As Wally tells him that Piper is his friend now, Barry is skeptical because of the fact that Wally revealed his secret identity to the public but before the two could end the discussion, Piper informs Wally that there is a gang war going on and it is about to turn the city upside down. As Wally suits up, Barry compliments his new costume while Wally was just asking himself what will Barry's reaction be as he never told him he is the new Flash now.Wally still couldn't believe the man who came back was actually his uncle Barry, that is, until he saw Barry visiting the grave of his wife Iris. Barry thinks about how proud she would be if she saw Wally in action, who in next moment tells him now he believes he is Barry and is sorry that he didn't believe him at first, because Barry's death hurt him pretty badly and he wasn't happy when he saw him, he was afraid.Few weeks later, Wally and Jay stop a gang of high tech equipped commanders. Unfortunately, the train ran out of control and was about to crush civilians. Jay and Wally were unable to stop it but with Barry's help, they were successful. Civilians ask the Flash for autographs but just as Wally was about to give them, Barry is the one who wrote the autographs. Back home, he talks to Linda about taking a different name considering the fact that Barry came back and wants to move out of the city which Linda does not really agree with. As the two laugh over different ideas for Wally's potential new alias, Jay calls, telling them that the commanders they fought on the train took over a warehouse but before he could go there, Wally saw Barry and the two speedsters met Jay and were ready to take the commanders down. During the fight, the commanders shot laser at Wally that tore the ground apart, slamming pieces of rock on to Wally. The commander screams he killed the Flash and at the moment he heard it, Barry asked him what he said and blitzed the commander with rage in his eyes, beating him up. Wally stopped Barry from beating the commander to death. Wally believed Barry acted that way because he thought the commander killed Wally but what Barry actually said that nobody else heard is Barry screaming how he is the Flash. He almost killed the man for calling someone the Flash other than himself.Wally asks himself what is happening to Barry as he never acted the way he does now. He reads a message from Pied Piper about the new location of the commanders. While Wally was reaching his location, Barry met him and they team up yet again. However they were trapped in a force field they can't penetrate or phase throw. Wally finds a way to save Barry and vibrates on the force field to allow him to phase throw and as he asks Barry to help him. Barry refuses, telling him he stole his name and identity, trying to make Barry Allen a forgotten history but he will make everyone remember who Barry Allen was and still is, by destroying Central City. Wally begs Barry to understand he never wanted to replace him, he wanted to honor his memory but Barry does not listen and leaves him to die. Wally only focuses on vibration and phases through the force field. He comes back home and sees Barry on TV having a Press Conference where he said that his protege Wally West, former Kid Flash is not dead. Hearing it, Wally throws his costume in the trash, feeling nothing but grief.Next day, Wally spend some time in the alley where Barry appeared when he was resurrected, trying to find some answers while Jay Garrick (the first Flash), Johnny Quick (a fellow Speedster from World War II) and Max Mercury (Jay's mentor) unsuccessfully tried to stop Barry on his rampage on Central City. As Wally started to lose all hope, he found a book about the Flash from a homeless person nearby which gave him the answer about all this crisis, after he heard the man reading Iris's name on the book. Putting on the suit, he came to the scene with the book in his hand.As the two speedsters try to share their experience about speed to Wally, Johnny mentions the formula he invented which gave him super speed. Max is trying to teach Wally how to get faster by telling him how Wally limited his potential because he is afraid of overshadowing Barry's legacy by becoming his equal. Jay on the other hand tells Wally he deserved the name the Flash and from now on he will call him that way and will no longer use the word junior.After Wally showed them the book he found, he had an idea how to stop Barry and he went to the Flash Museum while Jay, Johnny and Max were searching for Barry who took down all three Speedsters after they stopped the prisoners he freed from their cells. Barry ran back to the Flash Museum, just the place where Wally waited for him to show up. Wally gave him the ring with the suit inside which looked familiar. Wally find out everything. The man who everyone thought was Barry Allen all this time all this, the man puts on a suit and it was revealed that all this time, the man who claimed to be Barry was actually Professor Zoom, the Reverse Flash, Eobard Thawne, Barry's arch enemy from the 25th Century. Somehow he did not full only Wally and his friends but but himself as well which made Hal's ring think he was saying the truth. He was confused because he dropped the book which was revealed to be The Life Story of The Flash, Barry's biography from life to death. It could not have been written in this time because it is from the future, as some events mentioned still did not happen.Two speedsters, one good and one evil start to fight at the remains of the Flash Museum, Thawne explains how he still did not meet Barry Allen as he found out about his future death when he came to the Flash Museum, by mistakenly traveling into the timeline where Barry was dead for years. He wanted to travel to the time when Barry was the Flash in order to meet him because he was his hero, with the issue of Cosmic Treadmill and powers of super speed he gained by repeating the same accident that turned Barry into the Flash while changing his face to make himself look like Barry. When Thawne visited the Flash Museum, he found out his future identity as Reverse Flash plus the fact that his greatest hero will be his murderer. The shock put Thawne in the state of extreme confusion and madness, making him believe that he was Barry Allen.Wally plans on stopping Thawne but he has no chance as he is much faster than Wally. Thawne will not allow himself to be removed from this timeline as he is away from Barry and the events of his death so he tries to destroy the cosmic treadmill. When he tried to kill Wally, Thawne escaped when he was saved by Max, Johnny and the Hal Jordan (Green Lantern). Wally plans to send Thawne back to his timeline where he will eventually become Reverse Flash once again and eventually face Barry Allen for the first time (first time of this timeline's version). As Thawne appears on the TV admitting he was the one who was terrorizing Central City and is about to kill Linda, he was stopped by Wally. When he finally admitted he was afraid of replacing Barry, Wally realizes his speed never left him, it was just limited by his own psychic blocks and now they returned, just like Max said. Wally overpowers Thawne who begs for mercy, but Wally only mocks him, calling him pathetic and a victim of his own obsession. Wally jumps on the cosmic treadmill, telling Thawne how he might travel into the future and terrorize him like he terrorized him, or maybe even kill him as a baby. As Thawne uses the treadmill to travel into the future to stop Wally, it turns out that Wally just ran so fast it looked like he disappeared. He wanted Thawne to travel into the future in order to set the timeline the way it was suppose to be.The Flash Museum was repaired after getting destroyed in Thawne's fight with Hal but now they added the statue of Wally West next to his mentor Barry. Wally finally gets out of his uncle's shadow but he knows he will always be there watching for him. He will keep his legacy alive but he is his own man and not the shadow of his uncle. Wally looks at Barry's biography which turned out to be written by his Aunt Iris, Barry's wife. She is about to write it only few years from now, meaning that she is alive somewhere. He knows it, because she needs to write a book. Wally throws the book into the river because he can't find out what the history has in store for him, because his history belongs only to him.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When Hal Jordan seemingly went mad after the destruction of his former home, Coast City, and became Parallax, he was replaced as Green Lantern by Kyle Rayner, who took his place in the Justice League of America, just as Wally had taken Barry's place. The relationship between the new Green Lantern and the third Flash got off to a rocky start - Wally, having grown up with Jordan as Green Lantern, and also having fond memories of him to the point that he thought of him as "Uncle Hal", did not warmly embrace Rayner and questioned whether or not he was worthy of replacing Jordan, and was perhaps more critical of Rayner than any other hero was in Rayner's early days. The two eventually overcame their differences and became very close friends, like their predecessors were.During Zero Hour, Wally was seemingly killed while trying to help Rip Hunter and Waverider save the 64th Century and the timestream itself from waves of destructive entropy. Actually, he was flung backwards through time, where he invisibly and intangibly watched on the important points in his life as they happened. Wally became solid at the West Family Reunion, and turned out to be the "uncle" that gave his past self that pep talk. He soon returned to his proper time, but not until he had seen one more vision, a vision of his girlfriend Linda Park's apparent fate at the hands of Kobra, as well as his own death.Afraid for Linda, he tried to take out Kobra as soon as possible, hoping that he could stop the tragedy that he had seen before it happened. He hid all of this information from her as long as he could, and kept holding back his speed, hoping to not brush against the future again. In a fit of rage when Bart ruined his plans against Kobra, Wally raced home, and began to turn into a being of pure energy. It subsided, but it happened again shortly thereafter, and more so.Giving it one last ditch effort, and realizing he would very likely not make it out alive, he asked Jesse Quick to take over the mantle of Flash for him, should he die. This turned out to be nothing but a ploy to make Bart jealous, in hopes that he would get more serious about his legacy.Wally thought he had averted the disaster he had foreseen when he saved Linda from Kobra's laser, but did not expect it to play out again. He had to go at speeds way beyond light to save her, the consequence being that he entered the Speed Force. He traded her fate for what he thought would be his. However, he managed to returned from the Speed Force, despite what Max Mercury had said about it being impossible. Linda was still on Earth, and that kept him from leaving her forever. Upon his return, he quickly defeated Kobra and destroyed his geothermal tap, ruining Project Morpheus. This trip beyond the light gave Wally the power to tap directly into the Speed Force itself; he now mainlined the Speed Force, and this resulted in him manifesting new abilities. He accelerated the speed of Jesse Quick's injury, healing her leg instantly, was able to vibrate through objects like he did as a kid, only now they were atomized afterwards, and was able to lend speed to other objects.</hero:storyDescription>

Two-Face openly claims responsibility for the disaster but reports show that nothing is stolen, nor were there any high profile enemies at the scene that Two-Face would consider targeting. Oracle's investigation lead to the city of Arcadia, where Ghost is on the search for Malcolm Greymatter, a Civil War veteran kept alive by his own scientific experiments.Councilman Fletcher, while at a social event, reveals that his daughter is among 6 persons reported missing after the bombing of the International Diamond Exchange. Bruce Wayne mentions that no body has been recovered, and this may indicate she is not dead. The disheartened Councilman responds "if Harvey Dent has her, she may wish she were."Wayne instinctively assumes Barbara Gordon may be planning a mission to apprehend Dent, and specifically warns her not to. He claims that Two-Face is Batman's responsibility, and adds that if Batman needs help, he'll call.Gordon, ignoring Wayne's order, plans a trip to investigate St. Mary's Hospital in Arcadia. Meanwhile, Ghost is investigating the disappearance of a young woman named Debbie Scoggins. Both she and Batgirl end up meeting for the first time at an underground nightclub. Although they are unable to communicate verbally, the two quickly realize their agendas are compatible.With the assistance of Oracle and Batgirl, Ghost comes face to face with Malcolm Greymatter, the mastermind behind the disappearances of numerous woman in Gotham and Arcadia. While Ghost believed Greymatter faked their deaths in order to sell them into servitude, he reveals their deaths were real and that he was responsible for reanimating their bodies through the use of his "resurrection machine".Two-Face seeks revenge on Greymatter for reanimating the corpses of henchmen he has killed himself, claiming them as property. The conflict is cut short as Ghost and Batgirl wreak havoc on Greymatter's heart of operations. Facing defeat, he destroys the base of operations with a bomb, leaving no evidence of the reanimated bodies or the resurrection machine. Ghost and Batgirl are unable to capture the villain.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">As Jean Grey was returning on a flight back to Westchester from her European missions with new mutant Sooraya Qadir, aka Dust, the Stepford Cuckoos contacted her, informing her that her husband, Scott, had been having a psychic affair with Emma Frost. The Cuckoos were mad that under Emma's tutelage, Sophie had decided to play the hero and died for it. This was their way of getting revenge. Scott and Emma were in the middle of their psychic tryst when Jean Grey returned, and burst into Emma's thoughts, catching them in the act. Scott tries to explain, but Jean shuts him out and gets personal with Emma. She forces her way into Emma's mind, and they argue, while Jean explores the depths of Emma's psyche, looking for memories Emma has been keeping well hidden. After invading Emma's mind and stomping around in it, Jean leaves, and Emma falls into Wolverine's arms, admitting finally and lamenting that she has fallen in love with Scott Summers. Beast goes to check on her later on, only to discover, to his shock and dismay, that Emma has been shot and shattered into thousands of little diamond shards. Veteran X-Men Lucas Bishop and Sage arrive on the scene to investigate Emma Frost's murder. They lock down the school and begin questioning everyone. It is later revealed that Angel Salvadore had confronted Emma Frost and shot her in her nose (the flawed weak point of her diamond form), thereby shattering her. Just before this diamond bullet was fired, Emma realized that Esme Cuckoo had been controlling Angel and had forced her to shoot Emma. Hank McCoy busied himself with reassembling Emma's diamond form in his lab as if it were a giant puzzle. When he was nearing completion, Jean decided to step in and used her Phoenix powers to piece Emma back together and fuse all the shards. Emma was alive again, and the first thing she did was shout out the name of Esme. Bishop and Sage confronted Esme as she was attempting to escape the school. She easily defeated them telepathically and then left the premises in a cab. It was revealed that Esme had been dealing the drug Kick at the school, and had gotten rid of Emma because she had been investigating it. Sooner or later, she would have discovered that Esme was behind it all. Esme had been using Kick to enhance her telepathy so that she could take total control of the hive mind she shared with the other Stepford Cuckoos. Sophie attempted to fight back, and because of that, Esme influenced Sophie's brash heroism during the riot at the school, thereby steering Sophie to her death. It was not Emma's fault, after all.</hero:storyDescription>

Midnighter along with the rest of the Authority have been stranded in London (now Unlondon) due to the death of the Carrier. He spends his time bringing refugees to the Carrier's corpse as it is the closest thing to a safe location. He has to protect them from several threats such as diseased super beings called Incubites. When Apollo is infected by the Warhol virus (now calling itself the Burn), he attacks the Authority, seeking to use the doors to the Bleed as a way of spreading the Burn throughout the multiverse. The team manages to freeze him in order to prevent this from happening. Midnighter has a dream where a Century Baby named Gaia asks him to find her, telling him that she knows how to save Apollo. When he reaches the island that Gaia is stranded on, he finds himself under attack by a god-like force of nature called the Green Man, who turns out to be the former Doctor driven insane by the planet's demise. With the help of the team, Gaia manages to take control of the island and subdue the Doctor so that she can heal him. She gives Midnighter a magical apple and tells him to feed it to the infected Apollo. When he does so, Apollo is cleansed of the Burn and restored to normal.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Apollo to Midnighter. Kinda. Apollo isn't opposed in principle to killing villains, but he disapproves of the sheer level of Midnighter's brutality and unnecessarily painful ways of execution (if more because the gore could traumatize bystanders and the victims they're trying to save, not because he pities the villains). One certainly gets the feeling that if Midnighter ever were to dial it down a bit, it would be to gain approval in Apollo's eyes, though he isn't really able to change. Midnighter's acceptance of what he is, even though he doesn't like it, in contrast with Apollo's conflicting wishes to accept his lover and to make him someone better, someone Midnighter himself could live with more easily, are a central theme in the Midnighter and Apollo mini-series. In fact, wanting to be Midnighter's Morality Chain turns out to be the reason why Apollo chose his superhero name in the first place, in this version of canon</hero:tropeDescription>

When he arrives on site, he discovers that Cole Cash aka Grifter, the world's most wanted man, has also been investigating the crash. When Grifter lets slip that he knows about the Daemonite invasion of Earth, Midnighter attacks him, telling him that he cannot allow Grifter to live now that he knows what was supposed to be privileged information. Grifter struggles to fend off the attack, and manages to stun Midnighter by setting off a flare in his face. But even while temporarily blinded, Midnighter is still able to outmatch Grifter, who falls into a crevasse in the snow and is presumed dead (though he manages to save himself at the last moment). Finding nothing of significance in the wreckage, Midnighter opens a door to the Eye and leaves the Himalayas. After he leaves, the prisoner of the Eye slowly reveals himself: the Daemonite known as Helspont, who has plans for the invasion of Earth, plans that involve none other than Superman himself.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Cassandra first appears after the Joker's endgame, after Batman loses his memories. She arrives in Gotham to deliver a message to Dick Grayson from Batman. The message was for Dick to investigate a list of names affiliated with a secret criminal organisation led by a figure known only as Mother. Bruce intended for Cassandra to gather up his former Robins take down Mother and all those working for her. When an agent of Mother, codename Orphan, attacks Harper Row in her apartment, Cassandra arrives and helps drive Orphan away. She then heads off to find the Red Hood, another potential target of Mother. However, he believes she is the one after him and tries kill her, but Dick arrives to stop the fight before things escalate.Once the Robins and their friends are gathered, they begin investigating Bruce's message, but Cassandra and sneaks off with Harper. However, they are attacked by Orphan again. When Harper is wounded, Cassandra intervenes and drives him away yet again. Later, Dick arrives in the Batplane and takes them with him to Prague to start tracking down Mother. Once they arrive and set up shop, Dick instructs Cassandra and Harper to investigate someone on Mother's list: Prague's Prima ballerina. While they watch the ballet, Cassandra gets enamored by the sight of dancing, and almost doesn't notice when the dancers try to kill them. The two of them fend off the dancers until Dick arrives to help finish them off, but before they can leave, Cassandra runs off on her own.It is revealed that Cassandra went back to Mother's base of operations to stop her from killing all of the children under her control. as she travels trough her old home, she remembers her own story. Her father David a.k.a Orphan raised her is secret inside Mother's base. Rather than teach her how to read and speak, he taught her to read body language to hone her into the ultimate fighter. Whenever she tried to sneak out to be with other people, he would lock her in a pitch black, soundproof box for long periods of time as punishment. When she grew up, David presented her to Mother, but she was only upset that David kept a secret from her. Eventually, she decided to take a better path and escaped Mother's base. Wanting to see Mother taken down, she traveled to Gotham and informed Batman that Mother, who he thought was dead, was still active. Preoccupied with the Joker's attack, he asks her to deliver a thumb drive with everything he knows about Mother to Dick should he fall fighting the Joker. He then tells her that despite the terrible things she's done in the past, he is glad she chose to be more than what everyone wanted her to be. He then hugs her and leaves.In the present, Orphan catches her and shows her a hole filled with the bodies of Mother's children. Cassandra escapes and prepares face her father, but Dick and Harper arrive and knock him out. While they prepare to leave, Mother appears on a hologram and informs them that she rigged the base with a nuclear bomb to take hem all out. While Dick fights a recovered David, Cassandra takes Harper to the base's control room and covers her while she tried to shut down the bomb's countdown timer. When that fails, the two are surrounded by defense drones, but they all deactivate before they can kill the two. Dick found the shutdown controls after defeating David, and the three take him and escape in the Batplane just before the base explodes.The group then head's to Spyral's HQ to interrogate Orphan and figure out Mother's plan. While Spyral and the Robins try to come up a strategy, Mother uses Spyral's own technology to implement her plan: brainwash every child and teenager on Earth and force them to kill every adult. This include Cassandra and Red Robin, who begin attacking Dick and Helena Bertenelli. However, Tim told them that Scarecrow's Fear Gas could neutralize the brainwashing. Once the two teen s regain their senses, Dick takes Cassandra and they leave to find Harper and stop the brainwashed students around them. When they find Harper, Cassandra puts a fear gas mask on her. While she is no longer under Mother's control she tries to kill Cassandra anyway because she learned from Orphan that Cassandra was the one who murdered her Mother years ago. Out of options, Cassandra forces herself to fight her best friend. Hoowever, she holds back allowing Harper to gain the upper hand. Before she can kill her, Red Hood saves her, but the fear gas causes her to see Jason as her father, driving her to use Harper's taser gun on him. However, the floor is covered in water, so all three of them are shocked.Cassandra is later seen with Harper, the two of them having been captured by Orphan. As they are fly to Mother's base in Antarctica, she tries to convey an apology to Harper, but she is not interested in a apology. While she understands and is no longer angry with her, she cannot yet bring herself to forgive her. When they reach Mother's base, David presents Cassandra and Harper to her. Though she is pleased, she kills him and drops him out of the base. She then unveils a new group of Orphans, and activates her brainwashing program across the world, and have the two knocked out. When Harper recovers, Mother offers her a chance to join her. She then shows her Cassandra, completely immobilized and at her mercy. She instructs Harper to kill Cassandra and join her. Before Harper can move, the Robins and heir allies stop Mother's brainwashing program and Dick arrives to finish her. Both Mother and Dick try to get Harper to do what they think is right, but Cassandra, deciding to make things right, tells Harper to kill her. Having made her choice, Harper frees Cassandra and attacks Mother. However, Mother draws her hidden gun and fires, but Cassandra takes the bullet for her. As the remaining Robins their allies, and more Orphans arrive, Harper forgives Cassandra and helps her to her feet. Alongside Spoiler, they charge into the melee.As Mother and her Orphans are defeated, she decides to kill everyone by triggering the base's self destruct, which involves activating the dormant volcano the base is built on. Before she can escape, Cassandra leaps in to stop her. She easily best Mother, but instead of killing her like everyone thought she would, she vows never to take another life and leaves her alive. However, her father, who survived Mother's betrayal, stabs Mother and pins her in place as the base falls into the lava. Having seen the error of his ways, he apologizes for being a terrible father and falls into the lave with Mother. Everyone escapes alive, and Harper and Spoiler accept her as a friend.A month after Mother's death, Bruce has regained his memories and resumed being Batman. After talking with Harper about everything she learned, he instructs Cassandra to come out of hiding as Harper leaves. Batman tells her that even though she will have to live with killing Harper's mother, she can take another path. He asks her to leave the life behind, but she refuses to stay and help him in his fight as the new Orphan.</hero:storyDescription>

A meeting of mutant leaders is held to discuss their plan. Beast reveals that the mutants have one week left to live. They listen to Emma and decide it is finally time to go to war. Emma infiltrates Black Bolt's club and uses Dazzler to take out the former king and most powerful Inhuman, thus starting their official attack on the Inhumans. In her diamond form, she is impervious to his vocal blasts, and smashes his voice box, breaking his jaw and preventing Black Bolt from using his powers.As the events of IvX roll on, Emma leads the mutants against the Inhumans in a final battle. Black Bolt attempts to blitz attack Emma with his super speed, but she manages to eliminate Black Bolt from the battle by impaling him with her diamond form arm. The cloud is finally dealt with and destroyed by Medusa, but Emma attacks the Inhumans with reprogrammed sentinels, attacking their species in the fashion they did to mutants for so long. As Inhuman reinforcements arrive under the leadership of Ahura Boltagon, Emma has her sentinels destroy their ships, effectively murdering hundreds of Inhumans. The X-Men and Inhumans unite against her. She takes over Magneto to further the assault but the control is soon broken and she is restrained by Medusa, only to be freed by Havok and disappears. She is last seen donning a Magneto-style helmet with an X across it, the same design as Scott's final visor, waiting to make her next move. The X-Men, Inhumans, and Magneto all vow to hunt her down.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Wally's primary super ability is his super speed which he gets from tapping into the Speed Force. He gained a connection to it after the same accident that gave Barry his powers and his connection to the force was possible because of adventures they shared together. However, after Barry died and Wally became the new Flash, he subconsciously limited his own speed to the speed of sound (originally they thought Wally's speed was affected by the Anti Matter wave). When he admitted it to himself, Wally broke he psychic blocks and achieved a new level of power. However, when Wally broke the light barrier for the first time, he tapped into the speed force and gained a full connection to it, increasing his powers while giving him while new set of abilities. In truth, West mainlines the power from the force itself and cannot be cut off from the source, unlike all the other Speedsters (besides Barry, Thawne, Max and possibly Savitar). Wally is the fastest of all the Speedsters, perhaps rivaled only by his mentor, Barry Allen (although Wally has said Bart Allen is faster than all speedsters put together) and surpassed only by Zoom (Hunter Zolomon), Flash (Bart Allen), The Black Flash and The Black Racer. He is arguably one of the fastest beings that has ever existed and certainly, faster than Superman. He is currently fast enough to easily break all the barriers and even enter the Speed Force. Wally has, on several occasions, traveled much faster than light and been pulled into and exited the Speed Force by his own volition. He is one of the few speedsters who was able to tap into the speed force and get out without direct outside help. Like Barry and Jay, Wally has his own "lightning rod" which is his wife Linda. Without her, he is not capable of coming back and will go to his final resting place. That is why he almost stayed in the speed force when he forgot Linda's name while at the same time Linda almost fell in love in the Flash from the future, John Fox. The only reason why he got out was because he remembered Linda's name and Linda herself remembered she loves Wally. During the Rebirth, Linda forgot about Wally so he wasn't able to get out of the Speed Force without Barry's help.Superhuman Speed</hero:powerDescription>

Cassandra then proceeded to take a sword and impale Tim in the chest, triggering confirmation that she had won the tournament, being only the eight in history to do so, and activating a system that would 'immortalize' her, by killing her with a laser. Red Robin saved her from the beam, and the two revealed they had faked Red Robin's death, using a trick sword, blood packets, and a stopped heart to fool the temple's automated systems. They attempted to examine the base, but although Tim conversed with the assassin tournament's creator, a previously unknown centuries old immortal, the base self destructed before they could learn any close as to his location.Red Robin came to Hong Kong to assist Black Bat in Cassandra's hunt for Cricket, but Red Robin and Black Bat were defeated by the superhumanly fast assassin, badly injuring Tim including having an arm and several ribs broken, and Cricket promised to fight Cassandra 'For real' next time.Black Bat returned to Gotham to aid Dick Grayson in his hunt for The Architect.

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> The most common interpretation is heavily scarred, skinny, and (comparatively) small-breasted, but that doesn't stop some artists. In addition, her height varies somewhat. Her official height is 5'5", but while speaking with Bronze Tiger she seems much smaller. Furthermore, her eye color and skin tone vary significantly.</hero:tropeDescription>
    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Wally's canonically a redhead, but it's fluctuated outright red, orange, strawberry blond, or even outright blond like Barry. His eye color is also supposed to be green, but he's been depicted with blue eyes. While he started out in an outfit with Irisless Eye Mask Of Mystery in The Flash (Infinite Frontier), it alternated between his early-to-mid '90s costume or a bright version of the one he gained in the 2009 The Flash</hero:tropeDescription>
    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Underneath his mask, Deadpool has been drawn with various skin colors— gray, brown, red, flesh— and with various skin textures— looking like gravel, like a burn victim, like a fairly normal person covered in tumors, like he's been sculpted out of pudding— and his ugliness is majorly played up on his date with Big Bertha for the sake of a gag. It's been handwaved that his cancer and healing factor fight it out, thus his appearance is always in flux. Deadpool's costume details change with the artist, such as the size and shape of the black patches over his eyes, whether his mask is completely fitted or has a little tuft/flap/thingy on the back, having Painted-On Pants or more plausible materials, the kind of gloves and boots he has, and the number and specific types of weapons he carries. Deadpool's eyes when he's unmasked can also fall under this, being either normal or blank orbs.</hero:tropeDescription>
    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> The color and styling of his hair, seemingly switching with every artist —- as of his 2015 solo title, it's currently a dirty blond mohawk.</hero:tropeDescription>

When he ended up in X-Force, he quickly proved to be the most moral member of the team who called out the rest of the team whenever they did something that crossed the line. In fact, it's increasingly strongly suggested that Deadpool acts like a jerk towards others simply because he's afraid of being rejected.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When Cassie returned to Gotham, most of the Bat Family embraced her but not everyone. Nightwing still mistrusted her and continued to berate Batman about allowing her back into the family. Oracle and Batman worked together to try to pull Cassie out of her depressive angry state. There was nothing any of them could say or do to help her to move on, Cassie had been a victim, used and abused, and for that she needed them to pay, needed to finish her father to allow herself to move on. Finding the name of a doctor who had worked on the experiments of Cain and Wilson, Cassie broke into the Batcave and hacked her way into the bat computer, with Oracle watching and intervening. Cassandra pleaded with Oracle for support and understanding, Oracle her heart understanding the girls need for redemption helped her by removing all trace of her hunt through the computer.Cassandra continued to hunt for her father, trailing the streets she followed the trail only to find a woman killing several girls strapped to a massive roundabout table. The woman Marque was killing the new creations of Cain and Wilson, a new breed of girls to fight where Cassie had left off. Marque explained she had been one of them, but had managed to escape and now vowed to destroy their plans. Cassie begged the woman to hear her out and trust her but to no avail, the woman disappeared and left Cassie with a blood sample to test. Taking the test back to the cave Batgirl was confronted by Nightwing who had tracked her down through the use of the bat computer and had a hunch that she was seeking vengeance against her father. With his hunch being correct all along, Nightwing confronted Cassie and the two began to fight. They were interrupted however by the arrival of Batman and Robin, and Cassie fled from the scene. Knowing, if she had not they would try to stop her, the thought made her realize she would kill them if they did.Tracking down Marque she managed to convince the woman to team up with her and for them to work together to find Cain, but with the promise that no one would be killed other than Cain himself. During their journey they were put upon by Rose Wilson aka Ravager, the daughter of Slade Wilson (Deathstroke) the co-conspirator of the creation of the female army.The three women eventually fought through their issues and came together to hunt the men responsible, with the promise that Slade belonged to Ravager. The women managed to track down the training compound for this new breed of women but were thwarted as Deathstroke had been tracking his daughter and found the girls. Using the new army of girls he attacked the three, a massive fight continued until Deathstroke blew up the building making sure his daughter and the girls escaped.Cassandra is abandoned but manages to work out Cain's plan, when she overhears his phone call with Deathstroke she picks up the message that he is going to kill someone and it will shake Gotham to its core, realizing that he means Oracle she runs off to kill her father before he can manage the task. After saving Oracle the father and daughter fight atop the roof opposite the clock tower, Cain mocks Cassandra's skills and tries to use her own emotions of belonging against her, she finally managed to conquer her own demons and threw him off the building, but he managed to hold on. Watching as he slipped Cassie tangle with the demons inside her, the need for her father to die tangling with the training Batman had given her, she finally made the lunge for him to save his life, as Batman and Robin arrived at the scene. She could not grab her father's hand but he was saved by a lower roof top and sent to hospital by Batman as they helped Cassandra. Batman seeing that Cassandra had finally dealt with her demons, made the gesture of adopting her as he had the others in the family finally cementing for her the love of a father she had always craved.</hero:storyDescription>

One such migraine came at the same time The Renegades appeared from the future. The Renegades had come to arrest Iris West for the murder of Eobard Thawne. Wally immediately ran away with Iris, causing a fight between the speedsters and The Renegades until Commander Cold recognized Wally's ailment, Temporal Seizures.According to Cold, they are caused by time travel or changes in time. Cold makes a deal with Iris: if she came quietly to answer some questions, they could take Wally with them to cure him.When the group traveled to the 25th century, Wally was teleported to a different location thanks to Hunter Zolomon. Hunter had a way for Wally get his children back. Hunter told Wally that all the forgotten speedsters are in the Speed Force, and the only way to free them was to destroy it. Barry didn't trust Hunter and was forced to chase Wally into the timestream back to the present.The energy output from Wally trying to outrun Barry caused the Force Barrier to break instead of the Speed Force itself. This gave Hunter access to the Speed Force and other related forces, his plan all along. Wally and Barry chase Hunter into Hypertime, where Wally's temporal seizures cause Hunter pain.When Wally released all his temporal energy, it forced Barry and Wally out of Hypertime. Cold, along with Iris and Wallace, show up from a future that was destroyed. Cold's future tech found no temporal energy among the Speed Force energy, cutting the speedsters off from time travel and deserting Cold in the present.With this new revelation, Wally lost faith in finding his children.</hero:storyDescription>

Basically, its because Apollo thinks their victims deserve to know that their abusers are gone and will never come back. The comparison to Thou Shall Not Kill type superheroes like Batman or Superman isn't spelled out, but from the contextnote Apollo had just been explaining how his father threw him out when he came out as gay at age 12. And then just a year later, aliens abducted him and torturously turned him into what he is now over the course of his teenage years. And after finally escaping, his asshole father rejected him again, now also for being "inhuman"., it can be deduced that he thinks that these heroes are simply too privileged (white; straight; filthy rich or having a supportive family; not having been forced into their metahuman status; never having been personally tortured/abused/victimized, or at least not at a time when they were still helpless civilians, instead mostly getting Mangst type drama about other people getting hurt) to ever truly empathize with the victims of the villains they're throwing in prison only for them to escape again and again to destroy the lives of more innocent people. Note that Apollo's Establishing Character Moment on the New 52 Stormwatch reboot was taking down a child pornography ring, not dealing with some alien threat or a fantastical and crazy villain like most of Batman's rogues gallery.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma and Scott decided to pay a visit to John Sublime, who'd been preaching to the world that everyone could be a mutant. Despite his seemingly wannabe-attitude, Emma believed he was involved in a plot far more sinister. When questioned by the pair, Sublime had his U-Men attack Emma and Scott. One of them broke Emma's nose. She shifted into diamond form, unable to telepathically shut them down because she was being blocked by the captive Martha Johansson who would go on to become No-Girl. Emma and Scott were detained. The U-Men were given orders to sever Scott's head from his body. They were to later turn their attention to Emma to take her apart and make some sort of human chandelier out of her. While they were occupied with Scott, Emma broke free of her restraints and angrily took down her opponents, freeing Scott in the process. They located Sublime once again in his office. Emma telepathically stimulated the man's pain receptors so that he could feel what she felt when her nose was broken but amplified to an unbearable degree. Emma then attacked him, slamming him into the large windows, breaking the glass when she did so. She held him several stories above the ground, threatening to drop him. Scott urged her not to, reminding her that X-Men don't kill. Sublime let go of Emma, falling to his death. Emma told Scott not to blame her as "he practically somersaulted" from her grip.Cassandra Nova had been using her influence in the Shi'ar Empire to return to Earth with a host of Shi'ar destroyers. It was revealed that she had unleashed thousands of nano sentinels into the air at the Xavier Institute, infecting the X-Men. She then lied to the Superguardians, telling them that this mutant plague was contagious and needed to be wiped out before it harmed everyone else in the galaxy. The Shi'ar Imperial Guard attacked the Institute. Emma was taken out first so that her formidable telepathic powers would not interfere with their invasion. A device was placed on her head that prevented her from using her powers. As the Superguardians battled their way into the school, Emma was stuck, powerless on the campus. Fortunately for her, the Stepford Cuckoos were able to psychically learn how to unlock the device. They helped Emma out of her constraints, and she headed back to the mansion, where an understanding between the X-Men and the Imperial Guard had been reached. Unfortunately, Cassandra Nova did not halt her attack, still using Xavier's body. All hope seemed lost until Emma returned and tricked Nova into making a deal with her. Emma would provide Nova with a host body if Nova let her live. Nova agreed and entered the body of the alien, Stuff, who was a gelatinous blob programmed for learning basic things, meaning Nova would be trapped in the body of an unintelligent, incompetent alien blob.</hero:storyDescription>

Emma's Control Freak of a father gets the teacher fired (and forbids him from ever seeing Emma again). They later meet again when Emma ends up attending a college where he is teaching. There the teacher, Emma, her telepathic roommate, and Emma's new best friend get involved in a love rectangle where the roommate telepathically manipulates the best friend into accusing Emma of sexual advances in order to remove the two people standing between her and Emma. In response to this revelation, Emma mind wipes her roommate, then uses her own psychic power to hijack her best friend's mind and make everyone think she's a lying, crazy stalker. Afterward, Emma confesses to Ian what she did in order to protect him, in the name of being honest with the man she loves in hopes that he would not hold it against her in the event he wanted to begin a relationship with her at last. Unfortunately, finding out that Emma was a mutant AND had used her psychic powers to get her best friend labelled insane causes him to reject Emma, turning her into the cold-blooded villain she would become.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> While it's not always clear that he's doing it on purpose, it's been said more than once that one of Deadpool's "superpowers" is actually the ability to distract and confuse people by rambling on and on about stupid things until you either want to surrender or commit suicide from all the inanity — and yet, the whole time he's rambling, he's efficiently killing or otherwise getting on with whatever task is at hand. Often people underestimate him as a complete idiot because of all the talking, although occasionally someone will say he's an idiot but not underestimate his fighting abilities. For example, his irritating, non-sequitur monologuing and erratic behavior is exactly why he could beat the crap out of The Taskmaster. Not only because Taskmaster became so irritated by the constant flood of inanity that he got all distracted, but also because he couldn't copy Deadpool's unpredictability and insanity. And Deadpool knew precisely what he was doing by unleashing it in spades. But yeah, mostly he's just nuts. During Civil War, he used the phrase "addled moron that I am (or pretend to be)". This being Deadpool, it's entirely possible the "or" should be taken at face value, and he's genuinely too crazy to know how intelligent he is at any given moment. Deadpool also says to Cable in the Cable and Deadpool comic something along the lines of "It's fun playing the fool, but do you know when it stops being fun? When you actually start to believe it." In their first encounter, Taskmaster is detailing Deadpool's skills and abilities for a group of his students and states that Deadpool is an expert at using banter to distract his opponents.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Deadpool is recruited by a demon named Vetis after Deadpool tricked him in a previous deal. He is on a mission from Vetis to kill six individuals in order for Vetis to reclaim his power, but also on the side is trying to find a body for Preston to get her out of his head. After killing some of the individuals on the list, Deadpool learns Vetis is trying to overthrow Mephisto. In order to summon Mephisto Deadpool kills his friend, Michael the necromancer, who just happened to be on the list, in order to get him to hell to tell Mephisto about Vetis' plan. Deadpool targets a pre-cog user and teams up with the superior Spider-Man to face the Trapster, Batroc, Chance, Taskmaster, and Lady Stilt-Man. The duo end up defeating the group and Deadpool kills Gump the pre-cog, but Deadpool is subdued by Spider-Man for killing him, only for Deadpool to break out when Spider-Man leaves.With Michael in hell now, Deadpool manages to explain the situation to Preston's family and her partner at S.H.I.E.L.D.. Deadpool hunts down the next holder of power by the name of Bobby the Blender, who happens to be a shapeshifter. He takes the form of Luke Cage and tries to have sex with Jessica, but Deadpool intervenes when he is discovered by Jessica and attacks him. Bobby turns into Black Widow and jumps out the window with Deadpool in hot pursuit. Along the way, Deadpool gets beaten up by cops and Bobby turns into a cheerleader when Deadpool beats up the cops and yells for everyone in Times Square to get down to find him. Deadpool encounters more resistance, but most notably from Daredevil. The two have a brief fight with Wade getting tied up and escaping by breaking his fingers to get his gun and shoot a nearby pedestrian. Daredevil then takes time to attend to this person while Wade finds Bobby and kills him. Vetis arrives and Deadpool tells him his plan which angers Vetis as he prepares to attack Wade.Deadpool manages to hold out against Vetis long enough for Mephisto and the newly resurrected Michael to appear. Michael and Deadpool manage to defeat the demon and Mephisto eats his heart. They travel to Deadpool's mind where Mephisto tries to coerce Preston and Deadpool to make a deal with him. Deadpool refuses and the group travels to the closed off part of Wade's mind where they discuss how they will find a new body for Preston and help Deadpool with his memories.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">After the events of Flashpoint, Wally existed along the rest of the DC Universe until at one point, Abra Kadabra erased Wally from the timeline and made everyone forget about him. Wally became stuck om the Speed Force after this, and learned that after Flashpoint, history was altered and the 10 years were stolen from the lives of everyone. Following the fallout of the Darkseid War, Wally managed to escape through the Speed Force and avoid being lost forever. He was able to project himself onto the New 52 Earth, but needed someone to remember him before being revived fully. After several unsuccessful attempts to contact his friends and family (including Linda, Batman, and his cousin, also named Wally, who is now the new Kid Flash), Barry recognized him and returned him to life. After a tearful reunion with his mentor, Wally warned Barry of the universal change and dangers to come. Although the two decide to keep Wally's return secret from Iris based on Wally's own experience with Linda, Barry encourages him to return to the Teen Titans, but also recommends that he don a new costume to reflect that he is the Flash rather than 'Kid Flash'. Wally goes to the Titans, and through both physical contact and the Speed Force, reminds them of their memories with him. After an emotional reunion, he tells them of the situation. Wally believes that the unknown entity will attack again to prevent them from finding out the truth, which they will do "together" as the Titans.Directly after the events in Titans: Rebirth, Lilith has Wally repeat the story of his return in order for her to use it as a means of making the mental connections between him, herself and the Titans stronger. While doing this, she notices the most powerful thought in Wally's mind is that of Linda Park, which sparks various, but supportive, reactions from the other Titans. Nightwing encourages Wally to seek Linda out and try and make new memories with her. Elsewhere, Linda is still puzzled by Wally's sudden presence in her life and decides to investigate him further.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A raiding party representing The Fraction, an alien culture that has seized the power of the Speed Force through technology, lands on Earth to steal resources in the blink of an eye. To Wally and his fellow speedsters, time seems to freeze as The Fraction attempts to attack Earth. For the speedsters of Earth are what The Fraction calls organic conduits. They have faced them on other worlds and have so far proved victorious. Coincidentally, they dropped their spire headquarters between Keystone and Central City, the force of which killed a number of people, including Iris West.Wally rounds up the speedsters and brings them to Mr. Terrific's Keystone lab. The plan is for most of them to collect frozen survivors to keep secure there, while Wally and Barry find an escape vehicle. However, Impulse and Kid Flash recklessly went out on their own, scoring a Fraction tank, which happened to be full of metahumans, including Superman and an organic conduit from another world, who had answers about the Fraction. Upon learning they use technology to siphon and distribute the Speed Force, they plan on taking down the relay device.Rigging his car with a Fraction engine, Wally intends to drive into the spire and destroy the relay, however, he needs Jay and Max to figure out a way to get the frictionless barrier down. The other speedsters trick them into releasing more troops to take them on, while Jesse and Linda hold open one of the gates. Wally makes it inside and is too fast for their conventional weaponry, however, Admiral Vel Anthro orders the emitter to be used, overpowering Wally and seemingly turning him to ash. He was actually teleported to a new place called Planet Flash, where Gold Beetle and the victims of Flash's panic attack at Sanctuary were residing.Gold Beetle explained after her run in with Wally during his adventure through time body-hopping speedsters, she followed through on his requests. She saved all the heroes who died in Sanctuary and brought them to Planet Flash waiting for Wally. A future version of Wally gave her a head's up that he would need their help to take out the Fraction. She had new prototypes of their vests that would give them a small window before they were frozen in time by the Fraction's control of the Speed Force to give Wally an opening. He witnesses the leader of the Fraction scoff at Wally's family's plan to build up enough Speed Force energy to send The Fraction back through time. He knows it won't work without a connection to the spire, so Wally turns him into one. Victorious, Wally reunites with his family.</hero:storyDescription>

So much so, that Deadpool did not notice when Captain America was replaced with a Hydra-brainwashed fascist version of himself that was secretly mounting a Hydra takeover of America.His first Hydra mission was to take out Agent Coulson who was suspicious of Cap's behavior. Grilling his old ally Preston for his location led Wade right to him, but it also earned suspicions from Preston. For the good of Captain America's mission, he killed both of them regrettably. He also joined Hydra's version of the Avengers, thinking Cap was impeachable, but after fighting the heroes in the Underground, Wade finally started having reservations. He ultimately slipped the information Maria Hill needed to free the captured heroes, but lacking trust in him, Hill buried him under a parking garage.With Hydra fallen and a righteous Captain America returned while Deadpool was still pulling himself out of the rubble, Deadpool missed his chance for a legit public redemption. Instead, he is responsible for the deaths of two of his friends and is now hated by his daughter for it. Ridden with guilt, he put a bounty on his own head, hoping to be taken out, but no one was capable of killing him permanently. Desperate, he had his mind wiped, losing not just his tenure as Hydra-Cap's personal assassin but much of his time as a hero.</hero:storyDescription>
    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When Captain America is revealed to be the leader of Hydra and begins his takeover of the world, Emma strikes a deal with him to ensure the safety of the mutant population. With the help of Sebastian Shaw, Hank McCoy, and Xorn, Emma forms New Tian - the new mutant homeland. As a part of her deal with Hydra, Emma keeps the mutant population docile by telepathically controlling them. She also controls Xorn, who is a mere figurehead she has propped up as the King of New Tian. Emma operates from the former X-Men base of Utopia, which has been rebuilt. New Tian's mission is to take in all refugees, human or mutant, but mutants tend to be treated better in New Tian.Though Emma has thrown in with Hydra, she does not condone their actions and is merely using them to keep mutants safe in this new world. Behind the scenes, she is working against them. She has stolen a piece of the cosmic cube from Shang Chi and intends on using it against Captain America and Hydra. The members of X-Men Blue, led by the time-displaced Jean Grey and guided in secret by Magneto, attack New Tian believing that Emma is a Hydra villain. Emma's allies confront them, and Cyclops is taken to her citadel. Emma telepathically toys with teenage Cyclops, until the other X-Men come to free him.Eventually, Captain America realizes Emma has a piece of the cube and sends Hydra forces to invade New Tian. The invasion force has orders to bring Emma in, along with the cube fragment. Emma refuses, saying she will go and hand the fragment in herself as a sign of good will, and she will negotiate a cease-fire, not a surrender. She threatens to unleash King Xorn on the Hydra forces if they do not accept her terms. Emma marches into the capital, while the remaining heroes are fighting Hydra forces. The battle looks bleak until Captain America tells Emma he will not allow a ceasefire and will instead attack the mutants. Emma turns on him, promising no mutant will kneel to Hydra, and orders Magneto to tear Captain America's aircraft out of the sky, turning the tide of the battle.When Hydra has been defeated, Emma must once again negotiate with the US government, and the kingdom of New Tian is torn down, by Sentinels, no less, and the population is reintegrated with the United States.</hero:storyDescription>

Spider-Man's alternate version is a Well-Intentioned Extremist, which annoys Spidey. Deadpool gets along famously with his alternate until he discovers that alt-Deadpool isn't Wade Wilson, it's Victor Von Doom. Alt-Wade Wilson is a Big Bad who Deadpool takes down. Bruce Banner discovers that he can't turn into the Hulk in this dimension and is overjoyed, until that gets reversed. Then alt-Hulk and Hulk duke it out. One nice example involving Deadpool has him inventing an imaginary version of himself (aka, he willed himself into having a split personality) while trapped inside a room for over 800 years (long story). Why did he do this? To have someone to play hangman with of course. His plan fails when the imaginary Deadpool turns out to be a genius and starts totally kicking Deadpool's ass in the game.</hero:tropeDescription>

While doing this he would have run ins with Agent 37 of Spyral. In one of these run ins Midnighter kidnapped Dick and brought him to the God Garden, where he would use the Garden's technology to remove Dick's implants and place it within himself. Stealing the implant proved to be a mistake as Dick was able to use his knowledge of the implants to beat the Midnighter. Midnighter would end up teaming up with Dick to stop the Fist of Cain from using Paragon's brain to incite a riot at a peace rally in Tel-aviv. After preventing the terrorist attack Midnighter soon parted ways with the Gardener because she had knowledge of the attack but choose not to intervene.</hero:storyDescription>

This also caused her brain to develop learning functions different from most, in a form of dyslexia that hampered her ability to read and write for years to come. Training her in a variety of secluded locations Cain recorded many of their sessions.When Cassandra was 5, Cain began taking her along on his hits so she could be cultured to accept death and killing as normal. At age 8 he decided she had progressed far enough to test her abilities in the real world of an assassin. He took her to a hit where she would hand out the killing blow; the target Faizul, would never see it coming. At the time however despite going along with her father's wishes she had no idea what she was doing; she may have even believed it was only a game however after striking the deathblow, she "read" the target as he died and knew in intimate detail what it meant to take a life. This experience left her scarred emotionally and she ran away from her father for what he had caused her to do. Cassandra spent the next nine years homeless as a wandering, mute drifter.Cassandra spent the next nine years homeless, beating herself up mentally over what she'd done as she traveled the world. Entering Gotham City during No Man's Land, Cassandra came to be a courier for Oracle, even picking up rare delicacies like apples alongside her missions. Oracle took her on as a student and tried to teach her how to read and write. Over time Barbara began to see that Cassie had training and skill, but had been abused in some way. Cassandra became involved with the Bat Family after seeing the handiwork of her father, Cain, and realizing that he planned to kill Commissioner Gordon, she confronted him and saved the Commissioner. She was given the Batgirl costume with the blessings of both Batman and Oracle.Usually going out under the Batman's watchful eye she was finally allowed to go on a solo mission when a patrol station needed guarding against a local gang. Near the end of No Man's Land Batman noticed her death wish and forced her to make a decision between suicidal actions and self preservation. She opted for self preservation.Cassandra works as Batgirl with Oracle, and they become a team to be reckoned with. On time they were trying to solve a bombing at the diamond exchange that killed several people. Two-Face caused the bombing and took credit for it but the problem was why did six of the bodies disappear. It turned out they were being reanimated and used by a man named Malcolm Greymater (The General) in his crime-syndicate known as the Trio. The machine that brought people back didn't really work on everyone's minds leaving some complete zombies while others with slight memory loss that just got worse as their brains rotted. Good looking women were taken to a strip club where they would perform. Strong men were recruited in his own gang.Everything led them to Arcadia where she and Oracle worked with the Ghost. Two-Face also went to Arcadia on a separate issue of revenge against the General as well. Everything ends with Two-Face and the General killing most of their own men and the base for the General is destroyed as well with him getting away talking about moving to Metropolis and setting up again.Cassie's desire for a family grows ever stronger as she continues to live with Oracle and watches the dynamics of the Bat Family. Information on her childhood continues to be gathered as she studies her father and his movements, suspicions of her mother's true identity begin to come to light and she decides against Batman's wishes to chase down Lady Shiva and confront her about her true parentage. Having faced Shiva once before the woman had hinted at her role in the child's upbringing trying to get the girl to fight her as Cassie's new training in speech and her telepathy had thrown her off balance, Cassandra barely defeated her with a cheap shot. Later, Cassandra then requested Shiva to retrain her to read people like her. Shiva accepted her offer, only on the condition that in one year, they would fight to the death.One year later, Cassandra and Shiva fight once more, with Shiva killing her in minutes. Shiva then restarts her heart, and learns that Cassandra had a death wish. After learning this, the two have a real fight, in which Cassandra wins.Following the trail she heads to the latest home of the League of Assassins, who were lead by Nyssa, Ra's al Ghul's daughter. While making her way into the compound, Cassie drops in upon Lady Shiva's training of the latest assassin recruits. Preparing to attack, she was stunned to see the recruits address her as: "One who is all", the one who defeated Shiva in combat. After Shiva explains why she is in league with The League of Assassins, she attacks Cassie. While Cassie tried to get Shiva to answer if she was her mother, the duel was interrupted when Mr. Freeze appeared and froze Cassie. Somehow, Cassie convinced Mr. Freeze to let her go in exchange, she would help him revive his wife, Nora. When Freeze put his wife into the Lazarus pit, not only did it make her crazy, but it gave her powers to reanimate the dead and called herself Lazara. Cassie convinces Freeze to refreeze his wife by destroying the base of the Assassins with a freeze device. As Cassie made her way out, Shiva tells the students to pick their side, half go to Shiva half to Cassie. A fight breaks out and Cassie is attacked by her brother Mad dog. Mad Dog kills Cassandra, Shiva takes Cassie's body and walked away from the training session.Taking Cassie down to the Lazarus pit , Shiva threw her in and waited for the girl to be reborn. Shiva told Cassie the story of her birth while the women fought, finally getting the battle she wanted Shiva continued to tell the story as Cassie fought back, telling of Cain's use of her, of how he killed her sister to get a rise out of her. That finally he did Shiva a favor as she was stronger and better than ever, that Cassie could be so as well. Finally, Cassie was able to defeat her once again, stabbing her through a chained hook leaving her to die above the Lazarus pit. Cassie, realizing who she was raised to be, handed the cowl back to Batman and quit being Batgirl.Robin goes to track down Cassandra after she disappeared from the Bat family and found her to be the new leader of the League of Assassins. Believing her to have been captured Tim had bought along the body of David Cain as ransom. Cassandra was found to have been injected with a serum by Deathstroke that clouded her mind and judgment and forced her to obey his will. Robin tried to talk Cassandra down and offered his support to take her home, handing him a gun Cassie tells Robin to join her and kill her father to prove his worthiness an ordeal to which Robin refused. Cassie then, takes the gun and kills Cain herself, while he tells Robin that there are more girls like Cassie. A fight breaks out between Robin and Cassie until an explosion breaks out and Cassie and Cain disappear.It was later revealed that Cain and Deathstroke had set the whole thing up, hoping to work with Cassandra to create a new breed of Assassins. Using a new drug that would turn the girls into metahumans. Cassandra later turns up as a member of Titans East still under the control of Deathstroke. A strong member she works with him to try to take down the Titans, while under his control via the serum he has injected into her body. During her time there she faces Ravager Deathstroke's daughter and battles her, Robin steps in during the fight and injects Cassie with a counter serum. Her desire to kill Deathstroke and Cain begins as she sees what they have done to other girls like her and Rose.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When the Monster King took advantage of a centuries old land claim to turn Staten Island into the new Monster Island, a rich New York elite hired Deadpool to take out the Monster King. When he accomplished this, per the rules of Monster Island, Deadpool was now the rightful heir to the throne. Rather than let Staten Island revert back like his employer intended, Deadpool decided to take the crown and protect the inhabitants of Monster Island.Deadpool wasn't the only mercenary hired to take out the Monster King though. Elsa Bloodstone was also hired, however, she was impressed by the honor and nobility Deadpool displayed by protecting the monsters. She stuck around to help, and they even started developing feelings for each other. Among his tasks as King of the Monsters, Deadpool helped Strikeforce by giving the Vridai sanctuary after they lost their homes during the War of the Realms. He also defended his people from the new Kraven the Hunter who came looking for a new challenge.Elsa ultimately revealed to him that she was dying due to an infection in the bloodgem that gave her her powers. The infection was caused by a run-in with a Bone Beast Queen. Together, they tracked it to Greenland, where a village was sacrificing their children to it. To take out the Bone Beasts, Deadpool stole Elsa's bloodgem, allowing the energy to fill him up and explode. Elsa, who had gotten the sacrificed children to safety, returned to find Deadpool's conscious head, which she took into her protection until he could fully recuperate.</hero:storyDescription>

Wally can run to these speeds without it, but normally he'd be sucked into the Speed Force or end up breaking into the time stream, so it seems it works as something of a means to tether himself while using those speeds, or subconsciously push him to the edge of his abilities (the latter lines up with how the formula is explained to work).</hero:tropeDescription>

Also can steal speed from bullets and other fast-moving objects thrown at him or at others. Wally can also steal and borrow speed from other speedsters. A good example of this is when Wally fought the new Zoom, he borrowed speed from Bart Allen, Jessie Quick, and Jay Garrick. This ability is so great that he once took the speed from the entire planet, and its population, including fastest heroes of the DC Universe, like Superman, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner), Steel, Jessie Quick, Max Mercury, Jay Garrick, Bart Allen and way more, even tho they were far away from him. He also stole Krakkl's speed, who not only has the ability to move at the speed of light but he also absorbed the speed of his own planet's entire population (each of them having the ability to move at the speed of light). It increased Wally's speed so much, he actually moved and calculated time in span of a zeptosecond (Which is one trillionth of one billionth or sextillionth of one second). Wally was so fast at the time, he could run faster than instant movement, meaning he can be anywhere at anytime.</hero:powerDescription>

    <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma Frost appears in the 2011 film, X-Men: First Class and is portrayed by January Jones. She is shown to be the White Queen of the Hellfire Club lead by Sebastian Shaw. She is first shown when Moria MacTaggert sneaks into the Hellfire Club's quarters looking for Colonel Hendry. She is next seen going to meet with a Russian general who Shaw is supposed to meet. Professor Xavier and Magneto also infiltrate the building Emma is in and confront her. She is then captured and taken to the CIA headquarters. Months later, Magneto and his Brotherhood free her from her prison and ask her to join them, to which she agrees. She displays incredibly impressive telepathy defeating and blocking out Charles Xavier several times. She also possesses her diamond form which seems to augment her strength (she was able to send Erik flying into the sea with a single blow) and renders her immune to telepathy. However it does not seem to provide her any physical durability as Erik almost killed her by strangling her with the metal railing of a bed while she was in diamond form (a close up clearly shows it beginning to shatter around the area the pressure was applied, her neck) and Charles had to persuade him not to kill her, which he surely would have. In this incarnation, Emma seems to play more of a henchman-type second-in-command role rather than more of an equal power player as she was in the comics when she was the White Queen.</hero:mediaDescription>

As she one of the last remaining members of the X-Men, she had seen many of her friends and comrades die at the hands of Dust, including her lover who was presumably Cyclops. Emma remains in her organic diamond form most of the time as she is less vulnerable to attack and does not change back to normal.

They are making plans to cover the globe from attacks from Deathstroke and his Secret Society.

After the destruction of all the sentinels, one of the heads remains active and kills the younger Cyclops, causing the older one to disappear and cease to exist. Emma gets Christopher to revive the younger Scott Summers, and the older one returns back to reality. After the battle, the Uncanny X-Men leave and return to their school where they watch the footage of their fight for studying. Emma ends up having a telepathic battle with the older Jean Grey from the future by being a conduit for the Stepford Cuckoos' telepathy, but Emma is ultimately defeated. More and more X-Men from the future continue to come to the present. Emma, along with the rest of the X-Men, continue to battle the designated evil future team. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s anti-mutant weapon armament is completely activated, and the X-Men work together to finish the battle while they manage to stop the assault, but not without some casualties.</hero:storyDescription>

The first time he used this ability was to create a solid gold armor enabling him to run despite having broken legs. Later examples included sealing up the openings of his costume against disease and creating pockets for holding things. At times, he'll create walls of pressurized debris to surround an area. After his legs were healed and he got rid of the armor, Wally decided to discard his own costume and created a copy of his original costume, originally worn by Barry Allen but with sharp-edges lightning. During the Flash Rebirth when Barry came back as the Flash, Wally created another costume for himself which looked identical to his modified version.</hero:powerDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Deadpool was given the chance to audition for The Atelier, a pretentious and exclusive secret society of assassins and mercenaries. To prove himself, he is given 48 hours to kill Doctor Octopus. However, he is kidnapped by super scientist, The Harrower, who used Deadpool as an incubator for a symbiote clone. This clone is eventually born taking the shape of a giant dog and named Princess by Deadpool. When Princess chooses Deadpool over Harrower, Harrower tries to destroy it. Deadpool and Princess fight back but are also rescued by other Atelier hopeful, Lady Deathstrike and Deadpool's new girlfriend, Valentine Vuong, a mutant medical professional and Wade's contact at The Atelier.When the rest of The Atelier find out about Valentine's relationship with Deadpool, they brand her as 'compromised.' The head of The Atelier, The Horned Emperor, assigns all members to take the two of them out. The assassins attacked in pairs, but the first few proved ineffective. Deadpool and Valentine luckily had backup from Princess and Deathstrike. This only managed to get Princess on The Horned Emperor's radar, who now demanded that his fellow assassins kidnap the dog in addition to killing their targets. Alcaud'n and Ms. Gingko were finally able to best the two lovers and their dog.Once taken prisoner, Wade put together that Valentine had set up his audition for the group from the beginning. She needed his help to take out the immortal Horned Emperor and free Valentine of The Atelier organization for good. Valentine didn't expect to also fall in love with Wade as well. They plan another prison break where Wade is able to help Valentine strike the killing blow on The Horned Emperor, turning Val into the new Horned Emperor. Val was immediately overwhelmed by the voices she inherited from her former boss, but Wade's feelings for Val anchored them, clearing their head. With The Atelier gone, Wade, Val, and Princess become a new happy family.</hero:storyDescription>

It also protects him from injury from high speed impacts such as punches he delivers and receives from his opponents. With this aura he is able to absorb kinetic energy and inertia. Wally can sync his aura with his children, giving him the ability to pull either of them to him with a thought. The Speed Force Aura also gives Wally Super Human durability, allowing him to survive attacks from most powerful Meta-Humans without much damage, like Superman, Mongul, Green Lantern, Zoom, Wonder Woman and more.Speed Force Lightning</hero:powerDescription>

    <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Midnighter's abilities were designed by Bendix to give him an all encompassing advantage in close-combat and tactical scenarios. He has superhuman strength, reflexes (and moving speed when necessary), healing, senses, aim and various other enhancements. He is said to have multiple redundant systems to keep him fighting in the worst of conditions. One example of this is a backup heart. Midnighter can also turn his pain receptors on and off so he can keep fighting when the pain would stop a normal man. The pain is not totally cut off though, so his healing factor is also very helpful. He's fought with, and healed from, a broken neck, broken limbs, holes through his chest, having his whole body set on fire, contracting various viruses (including AIDS) and other things. He can also function perfectly in anaerobic environments when necessary.Midnighter's body has been altered to give him inhuman balance as well as faster nerve endings so he can move and react quicker than any human and many super humans. He normally moves at slightly above human speed but can move so fast that enemies with super speed can't see him. Midnighter's senses allow him to detect any modifications or powers in anyone he looks at, as well as how they work, so he can defeat them. His other senses are so powerful that to trick him, his creator needed to find an alien that could not only change its appearance, but its scent and DNA.Midnighter's most famous ability is his power to predict how a battle will happen before it starts. His fight implants include a combat computer that allows him to run through a given combat situation millions of times in his mind, almost instantly covering nearly every possible result before the first punch is even thrown. He uses this information to predict the actions and or reactions of his foes, counteracting their moves almost before they even think to make them. According to Midnighter, his powers also work by letting him see the outcome of the battle he wants, and working backwards, following the right steps to get there.He liked to begin fights by announcing all of this, but got bored enough with the speech to have it printed on business cards, which he can leave for absent opponents (or kill them by throwing the sharp-edged cards).In the tour-de-force issue Midnighter #7, we see his world view in action as the issue begins at the final scene when he returns from battle to kiss Apollo, and each following page takes us further back in the actions that got him there--ending on the last page with his initial speech</hero:powerDescription>

They find nothing and head back to the New Xavier School. Emma talks with Scott that he needs to apologize to David for kicking him off the team. Later on, the Jean Grey Institute Staff arrive at Scott's school and tell him that he needs to come with them about Xavier's will. Emma volunteers to go in Scott's place, but they all head to the JGS, and there She-Hulk begins reading the will and announces that Xavier was married to Mystique. Emma ends up being the only one to laugh at the new found revelation. Emma sat and listened with most of the Will as Xavier explained how he was forced to psychically and slowly, lobotomize a young mutant by the name of Matthew Malloy since Xavier could not help him and his powers were too strong to control. After Xavier mentions that this goes against everything he taught the X-Men that no mutant should ever be left behind, but he did to this one, only periodically reinforcing the psychic blocks he built in the child over the years. With Xavier telling them that the rest of the will is to be played after Cyclops and Wolverine, along with Rachel Grey, reinforce the mental blocks on Matthew, Cyclops has an outburst of anger. While he refuses to help Xavier due to being lied to, Emma is the only one who seems to get through to him, and thus, he leaves for Xavier's final request with Emma staying behind at the Jean Grey Institute.Emma is with Kitty and Dazzler when Beast walks in with the rest of the JGS staff to warn them that no one is going to help them, but that SHIELD is planning on attacking and killing Malloy, whom Cyclops is with. Beast gets an update that Scott was killed during an attack on Malloy. Upon hearing this, Emma storms out of the Jean Grey School and onto the lawn, and in her grief, causes a massive psychic projection that harms the staff and students of the school along with the Cuckoos back at the New Xavier School. Matthew Malloy appears on the front lawn in front of her, and Emma asks if he was there with Scott. After he replies yes, Emma punches him, and in reflex Malloy accidentally kills her.After Eva goes back in time to find a younger Xavier, she tells him what is going on, and they fix it by making sure Malloy's parents never conceive Matthew and Eva return back to her timeline, which has then prevented any of the teachers from dying. The will is finished and Scott inherits the Jean Grey School, but he signs it over to Storm and asks for her to take in his students, and all Emma says is Scott just shut down the school.After the events of the Last Will and Testament of Charles Xavier, Scott has shut down his school and transferred the students to the Jean Grey Institute. Emma questions Scott about the revolution and what it truly meant. She suggests they start all over. Scott shoots her down, but Emma reveals her powers have returned and that he is conflicted about her and that she is to him as well. She wishes him good luck and she leaves the school.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Deadpool heads to Sarajevo to rendezvous with his pal Weasel. Outside his safe-house awaits a bunch of mercenaries. Deadpool gets the drop on them and takes them out easily. Inside, Weasel informs Deadpool that he is a wanted man. Since Tolliver's death, a rumor has circulated about a will that leaves all of Tolliver's assets to the last man standing from his former empire. Being such a prominent member of Tolliver's operations, Deadpool is a marked man. Deadpool is less interested in the will and mainly wants to find Copycat. Before he gets any answers, however, Garrison Kane shows up and starts a fight. He is also looking for Copycat and won't back down until he finds her. It's a few minutes into a very intense fight before Weasel pipes in and reminds the both of them that neither of them actually knows where Copycat is at that time. As a piece of goodwill, Kane informs Deadpool that an old friend is back and looking to kill Deadpool: Slayback.With a growing interest in Tolliver's will, Deadpool looks up a man named Mr. Gezdbadah, an informant with a very special briefcase. He finds Gezdbadah fleeing from some mercenaries that Deadpool takes out easily. Gezdbadah is more than happy to pass along the briefcase, which contains a disc with information about the Tolliver will. The case is immediately taken by the Juggernaut and Black Tom Cassidy before Deadpool can inspect the disc. Deadpool and Weasel track the two men to a commercial plane and Deadpool boards it and confronts the men. Black Tom blasts Deadpool. Deadpool responds by blowing up the plane's hatch, sucking Black Tom out of the plane. Deadpool catches him with a rope and blackmails Juggernaut in giving up the briefcase. Juggernaut does so easily and Deadpool lets Black Tom go. The Juggernaut jumps out of the plane after him. Deadpool then announces that the plane has been officially hijacked.His life was forever changed when he teamed with erstwhile X-member Siryn to hunt down Black Tom Cassidy. In Siryn, he found a woman strong enough to endure the constant pitfalls of his dangerous life, but with a heart kind enough to see past his madness. Though Siryn didn't feel romantically drawn to 'Pool, he treasured their friendship enormously.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool wavers between being a mercenary, a good guy, or doing merc work for the bad guy of the week. In recent years, Deadpool has been trying very hard to be more of a hero, especially after his long-lost daughter, Ellie, comes back into his life. This puts him at odds with his wife, Shiklah, who wants him to stay the killer she married. He has fallen off hard again by accidentally siding with Hydra in Secret Empire. The Despicable Deadpool has him ostracized for his mistakes in Secret Empire, and receiving no credit for the things he did to help rectify the situation. He thus decides to finally give up on being a hero, and return to his roots as a mercenary.</hero:tropeDescription>

Remember Deadpool is ugly!* For the curious, Deadpool was happy to have an attractive face for about an hour, but eventually he became melancholic because while he had a face that people wouldn't run screaming from, it wasn't his face. He eventually came to view it as just another form of ugliness. Deadpool gets this again, in a sort of subversion. In Deadpool #64, Thanos curses him with immortality. Where's the curse in that? Well, they both love Death, so Deadpool would actually be pretty happy being killable. Torn between Cursed With Awesome and Blessed with Suck — the curse only won out because that was Thanos's original intention.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Starting in The New 52 and going forward, Cassandra has the ability to see the weaknesses in almost any person or thing she sees. Because she sees everything in this way, she can assess the weaknesses she sees and determine how best to beat or kill a target in a matter of seconds. Combined with her ability to read body language, Cassandra can both determine a target's actions and calculate the best counterattack, making her more dangerous. This ability is a double-edged sword, though, as Cassandra is always aware of which weaknesses will kill her target and which won't. Because of her vow against killing, she constantly battles the impulse to kill her enemies outright. However, because she is always aware of the ways to kill her opponents, she has to willingly ignore those options and attack in a non-lethal fashion. This nature of holding back makes her think and act below her full capabilities, which hinders her when facing opponents on her level, such as her mother.</hero:powerDescription>

Wally was consistently protective of Raven, and came to blows with Robin when he challenged her true motives.After an encounter with the Justice League, Zatanna revealed Raven's manipulation of Kid Flash. He was angry and heartbroken. Even though the Titans eventually came to her aid and ultimately defeated Trigon, Wally had a hard time dealing with Raven's deception. Complicating matters, even without her influence, Wally realized he really was in love with Raven.Shortly after this, Wally's high school sweetheart, Frances Kane, reentered his life. Frances' mother believed she was possessed by a demon; In truth, she had mutant magnetic powers. The Titans were able to deduce this although her mother still rejected her, fearing what her daughter had become. Frances resolved to learn more about controlling these powers. She also revealed to Kid Flash that she knew he was Wally West.Wally grew increasingly unsure of his decision to continue as a member of the Titans. His discomfort with Raven and Frances' encouragement led him to leave the team and return to school in Blue Valley.</hero:storyDescription>

When they all left, the grave was visited by T-Ray, who used his own urine to cast a voodoo curse and resurrect Wade. Unfortunately, Wade had amnesia and made home in a homeless camp. Meanwhile, four variant Deadpools are causing a lot of chaos trying to save the day in their own unique ways.He is randomly found by Weasel on the streets. To jog his memory, he brings him home and puts him in his old suit. Here, they see the other Deadpools on the news, so Wade gears up to take them out. They all end up being lured toward each other, but instead of fighting, they decide to team up. That is when T-Ray shows up to kill Deadpool again.T-Ray attaches the Gemini Star to Deadpool causing more versions to jump out of him including his inner child and his feminine side. T-Ray was trying to exorcize all of Wade's interesting personality quirks, rendering him a boring shell of a man. The Gemini Star backfired when a homeless ally of Wade's vomited on it. It caused all the personalities to be absorbed into T-Ray. T-Ray was rendered brain dead, while Wade was exactly the same as always.Wade took this as proof that he was always the real Wade Wilson.</hero:storyDescription>

The plan goes awry when the zombified forefathers become evil and start attacking people. Deadpool is seen cutting his way out of a large reptilian-like creature, disemboweling it in the process, which sets him and Thor free. When Thor flies away, Deadpool is told that the evil Franklin Delano Roosevelt is attacking the city. Deadpool heads to the location and begins a battle with the necrotic, evil president. The battle makes its way to a subway, where Deadpool manages to beat FDR via electrocution. SHIELD tasks Deadpool with stopping the assaulting presidents which he accepts, charging off to their meeting place to stop them. When he arrives, he is shot in the head by Lincoln, dropping him.The ghost of Ben Franklin resuscitates Deadpool and he eventually goes after the zombified Theodore Roosevelt, who is killing animals at the zoo. Deadpool defeats him with the help of an elephant, after finding out that the dead presidents have a weakness to electricity by having said elephant ram Roosevelt into a generator. Deadpool visits Doctor Strange to get his help in the matter of the dead presidents, and they learn where Gerald Ford, George Washington and Abe Lincoln are. Strange and Wade teleport there and attack the presidents. Deadpool is incapacitated by getting stuck in a car and punted away, and Washington stabs him with a sword. Strange takes the old saber from Deadpool and enchants it to defeat the presidents. Deadpool dubs the sword the Veto before stabbing Nixon, defeating him while the others escape.Deadpool does battle with all the other presidents, slaying the significant zombie powerhouses like Lincoln, and Regan. Deadpool ends up in a heated battle with George Washington after Washington killed Agent Preston, whom Wade dubbed as his friend. After slaying the final president, things settled down with the necromancer reviving Preston, but putting her inside Wade's mind.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma was freed from a high-security prisoner transport unit by Cyclops and Magneto, whose powers just went haywire. Emma is furious at Scott for all his actions and betrayal and Cyclops tells her it wasn't him and it was the Phoenix. Emma storms off and Cyclops tells her to read his mind to show her how sorry he really is but Emma reveals she cannot as the Phoenix altered their powers and her telepathy is gone. Emma also tells Scott they best not be near each other and when she was seemingly going to end the relationship right then and there, the cops start heading towards them as Magik teleports the group away. In Australia, a new mutant girl named Eva has just awakened her powers after her overprotective brother started a fight. The girl formed a time sphere around a block in Australia with the Police and Federal Guard outside the sphere. Emma tells the mutant girl that these are the scariest times in mutant lives. The team offers to help her learn to control her powers if she will join them. When the temporal sphere goes down, Emma shifts into her diamond form, and along with Magneto and Cyclops, she helps protect Eva and fight off the police forces.With Cyclops and Magneto discussing the issues at hand in a field, Emma tells them both a new mutant has been revealed. When Magik teleports Cyclops and Magneto back to the Weapon X facility, Cyclops storms and Emma asks what happened where Magneto tells her that the Original Five X-Men have been brought to the present. Magneto mentions young Cyclops and Jean Grey which is all Emma needed to hear as she goes to find Cyclops. She finds him on a hill where she starts to ask him what happened. While reluctant, Cyclops tells her that they were all real. Emma ponders who would have the technology and wherewithal to something like this. With Cyclops pointing out Beast would be the only one, Emma figures it makes sense since Cyclops killed Xavier that with Hank not being able to kill Scott would punish him instead. She shows up with Scott and the group to the Jean Grey Institute to deliver his explanation of what happened in Avengers vs X-Men to clear the air and offer the new students to join his side of things at the new Xavier Institute.Emma recently took Jean Grey to Madripoor after promising to train her in her psionic powers. Emma reveals her psychic powers have been repaired with some help from the Cuckoos, and with it she shuts off Jean's telepathy. She sends Jean after the Blob, and Jean managed to defeat him. Emma congratulates her and tells her she needs to open herself up more and the two head home.</hero:storyDescription>

They are investigating a distress call they received from Muir Island. They discover the death of Multiple Man, and upon further investigation, realize there is a Terrigen Cloud around the island. Shortly afterward, it causes Cyclops to die. Emma then uses her telepathy to make a projection of Cyclops as if he is alive and orchestrates the whole plan of Death of X. The Cuckoos help her project this image of Cyclops to everyone on the entire planet. Emma's projection of Cyclops gives a speech, warning everyone about the toxicity of the Terrigen Mist. She uses this projection to warn the world of the cloud, recruit the mutant known as Alchemist to alter the cloud and destroy one of them. She uses this projection to attack the Inhumans and destroys half of the Terrigen Mists. The Inhuman royals intervene and the projection of Cyclops 'dies' at the hands of Black Bolt, giving Cyclops a meaningful death. Emma later reveals to Havok that Cyclops died before all of this and that she simply wanted to give his death meaning for all that he did for the world. A truce between the X-Men and the Inhumans has been negotiated, and Emma leaves, giving them time to find a solution.</hero:storyDescription>

Luckily, Parker Industries employed a descendant of Van Helsing, Cami, who still had some of her family heirloom weapons. Wade and Spidey borrowed a few items, including an old stake they could use to track Dracula.Leaving the city in the trusty hands of the Merc for Money, Wade, Spidey, and Cami take a Parker Industries private jet to look for Dracula. They track him to Latvia and the house of a little old lady, who turned out to be Dracula's familiar. They found his secret hovel where he was defeated and weakened. By offering him a challenge, they are able to convince him to return to New York with them and face off against Shiklah.When they return, they find all of the non-monsters comatose after Shiklah activated a sleep device she stole from Parker Industries. Wade and his allies take on the monsters and are able to turn the tide briefly when Dracula is able to free the vampires from Shiklah's trance. Luckily, this also gave Machine Man, who was immune to the sleep device, to destroy the device and free everyone from their coma. Unfortunately, Dracula did not fight Shiklah. He proposed marriage instead. After a quickie ceremony, Shiklah and Dracula decide to abandon the conflict they were winning so they could get a jumpstart on their passionate honeymoon.Deadpool was just relieved that he had a marriage that didn't end with a corpse.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Deadpool and Cable's paths cross once again when the cult known as the "One World Church" hires Deadpool to protect them. Cable and Deadpool fight but due to a teleportation error, the two are linked and one cannot teleport without teleporting the other thus it's like the expression "You scratch my back and I scratch yours". Although they start out as enemies and find it amazingly difficult to be in each others presence, the two manage to become somewhat of uneasy allies after some time. Deadpool is there when Cable constructs his own island nation. Deadpool, after some time, accepts Cable's offer to join him on his island and the two become real friends, although neither of them would ever admit it. Deadpool even tells Cable about his origin, how he was the son of a military dad, and how Wade got in with the wrong kind of friends.One of them, eventually killed his dad when he tried to take Wade out of a bar. Deadpool gets inspired by Cable's way of life and tries to become a better person, stopping his former violent ways. This works out to some extend, but Cable and Deadpool clashed numerous times after that. One of their largest fights was when Wade sided with the pro-registration act group of superheroes during the Superhuman Civil War. Cable eventually took reign over the small European country known as Rumekistan. Deadpool was hired by the government of that country to stop this from happening and even shot Cable in the back.Cable however managed to stop the bullet and defeated Deadpool and his teammates of other mercenaries. He then joined with Cable once again, this time vowing to stop his unnecessary violent ways. During one mission, Deadpool took an agent of Hydra named Bob hostage. The two made it out alive and soon Bob became somewhat of a sidekick and friend to Deadpool whenever he appears in the comics. Not soon after this, Cable vanished during an attack by the newly reformed Marauders right before the events of the Messiah Complex. Cable's city was destroyed and Deadpool feared the worst for his good friend.Cable however later resurfaced when he tried to safe-keep the first baby mutant that was born since M-Day. Deadpool found out about Cable's mission and aided him in keeping the baby safe. They where attacked by various advisories such as the Marauders, the Purifiers and even some creatures named Predator X. After this, Cable made Deadpool promise to stop following him, and he told him that they would see each-other again. This however turned out not to be true. Cable was killed during the events of Second Coming. Deadpool was devastated. His former greatest enemy and now best friend was no more. He went back to Rumekistan (at least the thought it was Rumekistan) and tried to honor Cable by making the country a better nation.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In the new 52 Midnighter's ability to predict the outcome of any situation still exists, but appears to have been supplemented by a form of precognitive enhanced tactical awareness as well as enhanced knowledge. He is able to finish other people's sentences before they have thought about it, and when Stormwatch's map of alien threats to Earth materialized in front of him and Apollo, he instantly knew what it was. He's even able to defeat Grifter,despite the fact that he was blind.When he fought one of The Hidden people, it was noted that even when one of the neanderthal men was in his feral state. Midnighter seemed to have known what moves he could make before he even made them. He has shown the ability to read body movements and correctly discern what a person's power is (such as Harry Tanner's ability to lie and be believed). He's able to see through Tanner's lies and was able to figure out that The Shadow Lord was Harry (even though everyone else was fooled,and didn't believe him at first). He has significant resistance to telepathic attacks, as he was able to resist the Scourge of Worlds' attempt to use the Martian Manhunter's telepathy on him (to an extent). He mentions that he has carbon-fibre muscles that presumably enhance his strength. Midnighter has easily snapped the Vitruvian Man's neck, broke Apollo's nose and also caused Martian Manhunter pain (and drew blood). He is fast enough to dodge a bullet shot by Grifter at point blank range after it was fired, he also knocked out Martian Manhunter, Jack Hawksmoor and The Projectionist before they could react. Being fast enough to easily move out of the way of machine gun fire from a terrorist (that had the gun directly on him) before the terrorist could react. Harry Tanner reputed to be the world's greatest swordsman, struggled to land even a single blow on Midnighter since the latter could predict every move he would make. After a few seconds of fighting, Midnighter immediately knew what Harry's power was. Midnighter has demonstrated the ability to move so stealthily that the Manhunter and Hawksmoor could not hear or sense his stalking them until it was too late. His suit (which is a carbon armor) enhances his durability as he was able to survive unaided in hyperspace for a while, it also seems to be resistant to energy weapons (such as being shot by Grifter's energy gun yet having no visible signs of damage. Even being resistant to Harry Tanner's energy blades). He also regularly carries knives, throwing stars, grenades, billy clubs &amp; nightsticks etc. He also seems to have some sort of healing factor since his lungs and inner organs healed from the effects of Hyper space. He's also taken hits from a bloodlusted Apollo and Skallox (and stayed conscious). He's drawn blood from Etrigan with a punch, and dodged blasts from Etrigan with ease (something Etrigan even acknowledged).Due to still being relatively new to his older, Wildstorm counterpart, he has less feats (especially since he only appears in the new 52 for approximately 20 issues). Thus having a lot less to draw upon than his older counterpart.Other Versions</hero:powerDescription>

To give her some space to recuperate, Wally attended a new Terrifictech prototype test of a temporal device. As they turn it on, Wade is kidnapped from the hospital by Granny Goodness that seeks to use his innate connection to the Speed Force. At the same time, the temporal device brings forth the android Hourman, Matthew Tyler, who was previously lost in time. He had fallen into a timepoint and could hear into the Palace of Eternity, where Granny was discussing her plans. Using the waypoint set by the temporal device, he was able to explain to Wally that they may be able to save his so, but they needed help. They assembled a team consisting of The Terrifics, Ace, and Gold Beetle (from an early point in her timeline from before she met Wally).Upon arriving at the Palace of Eternity, they found giant monsters fighting each other just outside, as well as Omega-Bam-Man, an alien wrestler Wally had previously befriended. While many of his allies stayed outside to keep the monsters busy, Wally, Ace, Mr. T, and Hourman ran into the palace to save Wade. They were met by The Furious, a gorup of metahuman orphans kidnapped and trained by Granny. Thankfully, Wally was able to grab Wade before Granny could retreat. They even saved The Furious, whose parents happened to be Wally's allies. Unfortunately, their time travel device, the worlogog, was damaged causing the group to be lost in time during their escape.</hero:storyDescription>

    <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> During the first ongoing Deadpool series and in Cable &amp; Deadpool, Deadpool was a talkative loon full of bad jokes and other wackiness. However, he was also portrayed as a total psychotic with a loose, at best, grasp of sanity. All the wackiness was a cover to hide his immense mental problems and self-loathing and just the slightest nudge could send him over the edge in a violent, unsettling rage. Most subsequent writers pretty much ignore the latter part and play him up as little more than a goofy comedy character. His popularity skyrocketed after his flanderization and his flanderized version became his more iconic and well-recognized version. It helps that Marvel already has characters to fill the Canadian with Rage Issues, Regenerating Healing Powers, and a convoluted backstory complicated by Swiss-Cheese Memory, and a flamboyant joke-cracker in a red costume, whose snark covers up his inner angst roles. After Deadpool's flanderized "wacky all the time" shtick got stale with many fans, the Duggen/Posehn run achieved acclaim for its Character Rerailment.</hero:tropeDescription>

    <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Wally West has shown to be able to traverse time and dimensions with his own powers, unlike Barry Allen (although Barry eventually found a way to travel throughout time/space and other dimensions with his own powers) and the other speedsters. However, Wally now accelerates to the point that he is skirting the very edge of the Speed Force dimension or even entering it. He can traverse along the time-stream to specific points as they become visible, much like watching a movie in fast forward or reverse. In order to enter the Speed Force and time travel to different periods, he must exceed light speed, which he can easily and instantly do.</hero:powerDescription>
