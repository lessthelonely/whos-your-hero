  <hero:evolution rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Since the founding of the X-Men, Cyclops has been a stalwart field leader and one of the most iconic members of the mutant team. Professor Xavier chose him as his successor to lead the X-Men and carry on his ideals, a heavy burden placed on Scott's shoulders from a young age. Over the years, he has grown from a taciturn young man who lacked confidence in himself and his abilities into a powerful and capable leader, becoming one of the most important figures in the Marvel Universe. Strong-willed, self-disciplined, and fearlessly loyal, Cyclops possesses tremendous leadership abilities and excellent tactical and strategic skills. In many ways, Cyclops is the X-Men, representing their core ideals. Cyclops's dedication towards making Xavier's dream of peaceful coexistence between mutants and humans a reality has been a driving force in his life for many years.Scott eventually emerged from Xavier's shadow as the X-Men's undisputed leader. He also became co-headmaster of the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning alongside his lover, Emma Frost. Succeeding Professor X as the authority figure of the X-Men caused a significant change in Cyclops's character. No longer defined by his strict adherence to Xavier's ideology, Cyclops has become far more confident, audacious, and pragmatic. As leader of the X-Men, he has had to embrace his own vision for the future of mutant-kind in a world that fears and hates them.</hero:evolution>
  <hero:creation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Cyclops was created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby in 1963, making his debut appearance in X-Men #1. Though he was originally dubbed Slim Summers, his name was changed to Scott by X-Men #3 and "Slim" became his nickname.</hero:creation>

  <hero:origin rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Childhood's End: Scott Summers is the eldest son of USAF test pilot Major Christopher Summers and his wife, Katherine Anne. He was born and raised in Anchorage, Alaska, alongside his younger brother, Alex. When Scott was 12 years old, his family was flying home from a vacation when their private plane was attacked by a Shi'ar spacecraft. The attack destroyed all but one of their parachutes, which Katherine strapped to Scott while making him hold Alex. Katherine and Chris said their final goodbyes, pushing their boys out of the plane with the hope that they would survive. The plane exploded, presumably killing Scott's parents and causing the parachute to catch fire.Scott's mutant optic blasts manifested for the first time, and he used them to slow their descent, while shielding Alex from the landing with his own body. Though the boys survived, Scott suffered a head injury upon landing. This head injury caused Scott a slight amount of brain damage, affecting the portion of his brain that controlled his optic blasts. The brothers were hospitalized, both suffering from traumatic amnesia regarding the incident. They caught the attention of the villainous geneticist Mr. Sinister, who harbored an obsession for the Summers family.Sinister ran an orphanage, the State Home for Foundlings, in Omaha, Nebraska, under the guise of "Michael Milbury." Knowing of Scott's mutant power, and believing that he had more potential than his brother, Sinister had Alex adopted to separate the two, rendering Scott emotionally vulnerable. One night, Scott awoke and accidentally destroyed the roof of the hospital with his power. Witnessing this, Sinister put Scott in a year-long coma. Upon recovering, Scott was placed in Sinister's orphanage and subjected to torturous experiments.Sinister placed mental blocks on Scott and took on the role of the orphan bully Nate, or "Lefty," to torment him. He even murdered Scott's potential foster parents to keep him trapped at the orphanage. Sinister would ultimately fail in breaking Scott, however. As he matured, Scott began suffering severe headaches and eyestrain as a result of his mutation. He was taken to an eye specialist in Washington, D.C. Through trial and error, the optometrist Nathan Masters (Sinister under another alias) found that ruby quartz was the only substance that both restrained Scott's optic blasts, while also easing the vision problems he suffered. He outfitted Scott with a pair of special ruby quartz glasses, which the young mutant would come to rely on for the rest of his life.</hero:origin>
  <hero:origin rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The First X-Man: When he was fifteen years old, Scott ran away from the orphanage after his power emerged in public. His mutant metabolism reached a critical point, and he released an uncontrollable optic blast that accidentally demolished a construction crane. The crane fell toward a crowd of bystanders, and Scott quickly used another blast to destroy the debris and save them. However, they feared his unusual ability and formed an angry mob. Scott escaped the crowd by fleeing on a freight train. He was then found by a mutant criminal named Jack Winters, who became his foster father.The physically abusive Jack wanted Scott to help him break into a nuclear power plant, where Jack's mutant abilities were triggered by radioactive material. Scott only agreed to help and fight off the guards because he knew that Jack would kill them if he didn't. Professor Charles Xavier had been tracking Scott with the help of the FBI, intervening to save him. Defeating Jack with Scott's aid, Xavier offered the boy the opportunity to become his first student at the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters.Scott accepted the offer so Xavier could teach him how to control his mutant ability. Adopting the code name "Cyclops," he became the first X-Man. Cyclops's code name originated from the specialized ruby quartz battle visor Professor X designed to help him control his destructive optic blasts. Cyclops never managed to gain full control of his power, but he finally had the means to use it with confidence.He soon met his new teammates, other mutants his age. Cyclops bonded very well with the group, who gave him the nickname "Slim" Summers due to his thin build. They formed the original five X-Men. Cyclops was gifted with the role of field leader by Professor X, and over the years, they formed a strong father-son bond. He would eventually become Xavier's most prized student, chosen to carry on his legacy for mutants.</hero:origin>

  <hero:alternateVersionsDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When Scott Summers was still a child, his father was flying the family to Canada when their plane was attacked by a Shi'ar spacecraft. Giving him the only parachute on board, Scott's father threw him and his younger brother Alex out of the aircraft and into the Canadian wilderness. The brothers were taken to an orphanage run by Mr. Sinister, who later adopted the two and considered them the closest thing he had found to genetic perfection.Scott quickly became Sinister's favorite, due to his strong genetics and ability to lead. This favoritism would strain the relationship between Scott and Alex, who grew jealous of his older brother. Unknown to both Scott or Alex, their real father had managed to escape from the Shi'ar and made his way back to Earth in a Shi'ar airship.Unfortunately, he was also infected with a Brood egg and his ship was captured by Apocalypse's forces. He was taken to the breeding pens, where he was experimented on by Henry McCoy for a number of years. Cyclops began to question the treatment of the prisoners in the breeding pens, and soon began to secretly release them. Jean Grey was captured by Cyclops during a mission with the X-Men and sent to Sinister's lab. However, Cyclops became attracted to Jean for her spirit and dedication.He contemplated returning Jean to her friends but Weapon X had infiltrated the labs and freed Jean himself, encountering Cyclops along the way. The two fought in a ferocious battle with Weapon X taking out Cyclops's left eye, while Cyclops in turn blasted off Weapon X's left hand. Both Jean and Weapon X managed to escape, but a bitter resentment remained between Cyclops and Weapon X.After five years of being experimented on, Christopher Summers managed to escape from the breeding pens, much to Sinister's chagrin. He ordered his recapture but told Alex and Scott to remain behind, which made Scott suspicious of the nature of this mission. After the search team's emergency beacon was picked up, Cyclops and Havok went to investigate in the Ghost Lands. There, they encountered their long lost father. Christopher told them the story of how they became separated, which was enough to convince Havok that he was telling the truth. Cyclops, however, wasn't so easily swayed.During a battle between some scavengers, Sinister came and rescued the Summers family. Unfortunately, the Brood egg that was inside of Christopher hatched and he proceeded to attack Sinister. Before he could cause any further harm, Christopher's consciousness became dominant and he begged Scott to kill him. Scott reluctantly complied and killed his father. This act caused a further rift between Scott and Alex, who now blamed him for the death of their father.Cyclops soon learned that Apocalypse's Horseman, Death, was trying to cause a mutiny and seize power for himself. Cyclops knew he had to make a stand and helped Blink free her captured teammates and release Sunfire from his prison. Blink teleported Cyclops and her teammates to safety as Sunfire incinerated Death. It was around this time that Sinister had created X-Man using both Scott and Jean as genetic templates, who were both unaware of this development. Sinister planned to use X-Man to overthrow Apocalypse as ruler.On one occasion, Cyclops came into contact with X-Man and tried to help him escape from the pens. However, the rash mutant refused his help and escaped the pens by himself. Both were unaware of their relationship to each other or that they were secretly being watched by Sinister himself. Cyclops also became increasingly concerned by Sinister's sudden disappearances. He broke into Sinister's lab and discovered the place had been trashed. Cyclops realized that Sinister had abandoned them and betrayed Apocalypse.Cyclops continued to rescue people from the breeding pens. Unfortunately, people began to suspect that something was amiss. They questioned a young mutant named Lorna Dane, who witnessed the previous nights escape. Unfortunately, Lorna had a fragile mind and thought she had witnessed Magneto rescuing the prisoners. Havok ordered that she be interrogated by the Dark Beast, but Cyclops stopped the torture and ordered her release back to the pens.That night, Cyclops broke into the pens, while in disguise, and rescued Lorna. However, his activities were detected by Northstar and Aurora. With his face hidden in the darkness, Cyclops attacked the twins and made his getaway. Meeting with a member of the underground at the Hudson River, Cyclops turned Lorna over to them. However, his face was no longer in disguise and his activities were being monitored by Havok from a distance. Jean returned to Sinister's lab in an attempt to locate him, but she was captured by Havok and sent to the Beast.Cyclops was stunned to see Jean again and when he refused Havok's order to kill her, Havok revealed that he knew Cyclops had been helping the prisoners escape from the pens. Cyclops was then captured and, along with Jean, tortured by the Beast. However, Jean used her psychic powers to remove Cyclops' visor and he released a concussive blast on the Beast, rendering him unconscious.Cyclops and Jean escaped and tried to free the prisoners in the breeding pens. However, Apocalypse had ordered that all of the prisoners be killed as a means to convey his message of survival of the fittest. Cyclops and Jean met with X-Man, who had come to bring an end to Apocalypse's rule. X-Man discovered that the two were his parents, while Jean and Scott both felt a strange connection to the boy. Scott and Jean then made their way to the Brain Trust, which had anesthetized the prisoners so that they lacked the will to escape.Jean used her psychic powers to destroy the Brain Trust as Cyclops ordered the Bedlam Brothers, who had also betrayed Apocalypse's rule, to disable the main generators and knock out all of the lights. As the prisoners escaped, Cyclops and Jean fought Havok. Cyclops managed to knock Havok unconscious, but could not bring himself to kill his brother. Cyclops and Jean then led the prisoners to safety, but Jean sensed that the Human High Council had unleashed bombs that were making their way towards Apocalypse's America.In an attempt to hold the bombs back, Jean blanketed the sky with a telekinetic shield. Havok had managed to track down Cyclops and Jean, and proceeded to slay Jean with his powers. Cyclops confronted his brother, but was defeated and nearly killed as well. As Havok gloated over the defeat of his brother, Weapon X killed him to avenge the death of his beloved.Weapon Omega has ascended as new ruler of Age of Apocalypse. Cyclops reappears as head minister of Famineï¿½s control, under the control of Weapon Omega. He was revived by Dark Beast and Sugar Man using the power of the Life Seed.</hero:alternateVersionsDescription>

  <hero:alternateVersionsDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When Scott Summers developed his mutant optic blasts, he trained himself to operate blind, fearful of the damage his powers could cause. He dated Lorna Dane, a mutant who possessed magnetic powers, until she left him for his older brother Alex. Later, Scott was rescued from a lynch mob by the mutant telepath Charles Xavier, who recruited him to be the first X-Man.He took the code name "Cyclops" and was outfitted with a dark blue and gold uniform standard to the initial X-Men. The suit, composed of high-tech latex and Kevlar, also acted as a cloaking device that disguised his mutant bio-signature from Sentinels. He could release an optic blast either by pressing on a button on either side of his visor, or by pressing a concealed button in the palm of his gloves.Scott became considerably infatuated with Jean Grey, codenamed "Marvel Girl", another prodigy of Professor Xavier. Prior to the X-Men's first mission it took Scott an entire year and a half to develop the courage to ask Jean out to go see a movie with him, according to Jean.Though shy and timid when it came to the subject of Jean Grey, Cyclops acted as the team's field leader, at first to the chagrin of newly recruited Colossus who cited Cyclops' age as he was a year younger than him. Cyclops' first recorded mission with the X-Men was the rescue and eventual recruitment of Robert Drake, soon to be code-named "Iceman". His second was the rescue of the deadly mutant Wolverine, who also joined the X-Men, albeit initially as a means to assassinate Professor X for Magneto.It would only take a short time for Cyclops to develop a tumultuous relationship with Wolverine, as Wolverine found himself very attracted to Jean Grey. After the X-Men's third mission, the rescue of the U.S. President's kidnapped daughter from the Brotherhood of Evil, Cyclops became disillusioned with the X-Men's goals. This was allegedly because of Xavier's dealings with an anti-mutant U.S. administration, but also because he had witnessed a mutual kiss between Marvel Girl and Wolverine.Cyclops then took the Blackbird, abandoned the X-Men, and joined the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. He participated in their bombings of Parliament and the MI6 building. When Magneto lead an army of Sentinels to Washington in retaliation for a government sponsored attack on the Savage Land, Cyclops quit the Brotherhood of Mutants and alerted the X-Men. He even convinced Magneto's son Quicksilver to play a role in defeating his father. Cyclops would return to the X-Men and lead them in many more missions, including bouts with Sentinels, a hunt for Sinister, and a rescue mission for Rogue.When teammate Colossus quit and returned to Russia, Cyclops and Marvel Girl followed and convinced him to rejoin. During this period, Cyclops and Jean grew closer and soon after became a couple. Though his relationship with Jean had already ended, a jealous Wolverine fought with Scott. Professor Xavier tried to force the two to cooperate, sending them on a mission together to the Savage Land in order to find missing U.S. marines. There they faced a sentient computer and its army of cyborg zombies. While fleeing a collapsing underground complex, Wolverine chose to let Cyclops fall into a chasm.Cyclops survived the fall, albeit severely injured, and clung to life by eating grubs and worms to survive. After twenty-six days he was found by Brotherhood members, who failed to recognize him, and took him back to their new base for medical treatment. When Magneto plotted to reverse Earth's magnetic fields, Cyclops summoned the X-Men in time to stop him. Cyclops confronted Wolverine, and violently removed him from the team after blasting him to the ground.Months later, Cyclops invited Wolverine back, feeling it was his best chance to rehabilitate. Scott was reunited with his estranged brother Alex, who had joined Emma Frost's rival mutant educational program, the Academy of Tomorrow. They failed to resolve their differences.When Lorna Dane, now called Polaris, lost control of her powers and killed several people, Cyclops tried to prevent Alex and other Frost students from breaking into the Triskelion to rescue her. Cyclops is killed at the end of Ultimatum by Quicksilver.</hero:alternateVersionsDescription>

Jean soon realized that she also had feelings for Scott, and they started a relationship. They became almost inseparable. Even when Xavier was thought to be dead, and the X-Men split up, Scott and Jean stayed together.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">After the original five X-Men were formed, Cyclops' long lost brother Alex was discovered. Like Cyclops, he had developed a highly destructive mutant power which was detected by Cerebro. Adopting the code name "Havok", Alex became a member of the X-Men. An unusual genetic quirk existed between the two brothers, with neither of them able to hurt the other with their mutant powers. Instead, they would absorb the energy the other directed at them. However, as Cyclops was more tactically minded and experienced in battle, he would always best Havok in brotherly scraps.</hero:storyDescription>

The Professor assembled a new team of mutants to save his original X-Men. Cyclops' long lost brother Kid Vulcan was one of the members. The team failed, and was believed to be dead. Cyclops had managed to escape, but had lost his ruby quartz visor and his power was inactive. Using the X-Men's jet, he made his way to Professor X for help. Xavier was distraught by the death of the team, and by his own failure, so he wiped all knowledge of the team from Cyclops' mind including all knowledge of his brother.Another team of international X-Men was assembled by Xavier, with Cyclops leading them back to battle Krakoa. The new team successfully rescued the original X-Men. However, the old team decided to leave both the mansion and the X-Men behind, moving on now that they had matured. Cyclops chose to remain at the school, for fear his uncontrollable power wouldn't allow him to fit into society.He continued to be Xavier's deputy leader, and acted as field leader to the new team of X-Men. The team was not initially as tight-knit as the original X-Men, despite the hard training Cyclops put them through. Thunderbird was killed during the new team's second mission against Count Nefaria and his Ani-Men, which haunted Cyclops and made him question his ability to lead.</hero:storyDescription>

He found that he had a new rival for her affections in the form of Wolverine. The Canadian X-Man had a much wilder personality compared to the disciplined Cyclops, and he was quite open about his attraction to Jean. Shortly after she left the X-Men, Jean was kidnapped by Sentinels along with Professor X, Wolverine, and Banshee, and taken to an abandoned SHIELD space station. There, the anti-mutant activist Steven Lang unveiled his plans for an all new generation of Sentinels. The X-Men arrived to defeat Lang and rescue their teammates, but their escape shuttle was damaged.A solar storm began to leak lethal radiation into the shuttle as the X-Men made their way back to Earth. Jean volunteered to pilot the shuttle, absorbing the knowledge to operate it from Dr. Peter Corbeau and using her telekinesis to shield herself from the radiation. The other X-Men were placed in stasis for their protection. However, Jean started to succumb to the radiation's lethal effects.The cosmic entity known as the Phoenix Force responded to Jean's anguished telepathic call. The Phoenix Force reformed itself after Jean's own image and consciousness, then placed her in suspended animation in a cocoon at the bottom of Jamaica Bay.The shuttle reentered the Earth's atmosphere, crashing in Jamaica Bay. The X-Men swam safely to the surface, but there was no sign of Marvel Girl. Suddenly, the water erupted, and the "Phoenix" emerged in Jean's form. She declared herself "fire and life incarnate" to the X-Men, before collapsing.</hero:storyDescription>

It transpired that Christopher and his wife Katherine Anne were taken from their burning plane by a group of intergalactic slavers.

However, he started to privately question their relationship, feeling that the reborn Jean was not the same Jean he had fallen in love with. When Cyclops thought that the Phoenix was dead for a period of time after they were separated in the Savage Land, he felt unable to mourn her. Believing this meant that he no longer loved Jean, Cyclops briefly dated Colleen Wing.The Phoenix was reunited with Cyclops when the X-Men stopped Moira MacTaggert's mutant son, Proteus, from destroying reality. Cyclops rediscovered his love for Phoenix, and they shared a romantic kiss on the way home. Cyclops was impressed with Phoenix's new found level of control over her immense powers. She created a special 'psychic bond' between herself and Cyclops, so they could always contact each other.After a battle with the Hellfire Club over the recruitment of the mutant pop star Dazzler, Phoenix and Cyclops shared an intimate night together. Phoenix flew them both to a deserted area, where she removed Cyclops' ruby quartz visor, and told him to open his eyes. Wary at first, Cyclops eventually opened his eyes.Phoenix used her telekinesis to keep Cyclops' powers in check, so that he could see without the aid of his visor. It was the first time since puberty that Cyclops was able to see without the aid of ruby quartz. The couple embraced, kissed, and made love in the lonely desert.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Phoenix soon began to experience realistic illusions where she lived in 18th century England and was betrothed to a man known only as Nikos. She didn't confide in Cyclops what had been happening to her. It turned out that the old X-Men foe, Mastermind, had his powers of illusion boosted by a psionic mind-tap device created by the Hellfire Club's White Queen, Emma Frost.Mastermind had been creating the illusions in Phoenix's mind, making her believe that she was his 18th century lover, Lady Grey. Phoenix had even assumed the role of the Hellfire Club's new Black Queen. She relished in all the decadent freedom and power that the position afforded her, but Cyclops remained in contact with Jean through their special psychic bond as the X-Men battled the Hellfire Club over the soul of the Phoenix.Using this connection, Cyclops engaged Mastermind in a psychic duel when the X-Men came to rescue Phoenix. Mastermind defeated Cyclops. Cyclops' defeat broke Mastermind's hold over Phoenix's psyche, but also any control Jean had over the Phoenix. Transformed into the Dark Phoenix, she quickly defeated Mastermind by devastating his mind with her godlike powers before flying into space.While the Phoenix represented the light and life of the universe, the Dark Phoenix represented power and destruction. Flying to a distant galaxy, the Dark Phoenix devoured the star of the D'Bari system to sate its hunger for power, killing billions of innocent people in the process. The Shi'ar Empress Lilandra was alerted and summoned an intergalactic council that included the Kree and Skrull empires. They concluded that, for the rest of the universe to live, the Dark Phoenix must be destroyed. The fate of Jean Grey had been decided.Meanwhile, Beast had found a way to temporarily neutralize Phoenix's power. When Dark Phoenix returned to Earth, the X-Men held her at bay while Professor X worked to rebuild the mental blocks in her brain that Mastermind had broken down. The Phoenix threatened to kill all of them, but Cyclops kept trying to reach out to her. Eventually the Phoenix returned to normal and Cyclops finally proposed to her, just as they are teleported away by the Shi'ar to their flagship. Lilandra announced that the Phoenix, who everyone believed to be Jean, had to die. Unwilling to let one his students be killed, Xavier challenged Lilandra (who he was romantically involved with) to a duel she couldn't refuse. Professor X named the X-Men as his champions, while Lilandra named her Imperial Guard.The battle took place the next day on the Blue Area of the Moon. The Imperial Guard quickly defeated the X-Men, leaving Cyclops and Phoenix to make a final stand. The battle triggered Phoenix's transformation into Dark Phoenix once more. Lilandra ordered Plan Omega, which would destroy the entire solar system in hopes of eliminating the Dark Phoenix.Professor X ordered the X-Men to subdue Phoenix so this would not be necessary. After the X-Men managed to subdue Phoenix, she realized that she would never be able to control herself and fled to a back alley. Cyclops chased after her, but Phoenix subdued him by using her telekinesis.She told Cyclops that she was losing control and that there was only one way to prevent the Dark Phoenix from taking dominance again. Phoenix then activated an ancient Kree energy weapon and, after bidding Cyclops an emotional farewell, sacrificed herself. Cyclops and the X-Men mourned.</hero:storyDescription>

It wasn't long before they were married, and Maddie became pregnant with their son. Cyclops returned to the X-Men with Maddie at his side. Once there, he struggled to maintain a healthy balance between his role as an X-Man and that of a husband and soon-to-be father. Scott resumed leadership of the X-Men and took the team to Asgard to rescue the New Mutants.After their return to Earth, they went to France to fend off the riots outside of Magneto's trial for his crimes as a terrorist. Magneto was successfully pardoned for his crime, and joined with the X-Men. While Cyclops was away from the mansion with the X-Men, Maddie was left alone. During her solitude in the mansion, her water broke and she gave birth to their son in the kitchen of the mansion. Without Cyclops' agreement, she named the boy Nathan. This caused an intense argument between Maddie and Cyclops. Cyclops had wanted to name his son Christopher Charles, after the two fathers in his life, with the name "Nathan" reminding him of the bully from the orphanage where he grew up.</hero:storyDescription>

With her resurrection Jean, was returned to her former teammates Angel, Beast, and Iceman. Marvel Girl couldn't understand why the world had changed so much, that their mentor had abandoned them to live in space while their former foe Magneto was leading the X-Men. The others had grown tired of trying to fit into regular everyday life, and with Jean's miraculous return from the dead they decided to reform the original team of X-Men.When they made the phone call to Cyclops to inform him of Marvel Girl's return, he was in the middle of an argument with Madelyne.

With her growing telepathic and telekinetic powers, the Goblin Queen sent her hordes of demons to find her missing son. She wanted her revenge on Scott by destroying the only evidence of their marriage, she was going to murder Nathan.Cyclops and Marvel Girl returned to New York and were reunited with the other members of X-Factor. There, they were forced to battle the demon-possessed members of the X-Men. Wolverine gladly battled Cyclops, which distracted Cyclops from saving his son. Eventually, the X-Men overcame their demonic urges and the two mutant teams joined forces to fight their common enemy. They pursued the Goblin Queen into her growing tower above Manhattan. Cyclops was forced to battle his brother Havok, who had become the "Goblin Prince", Madelyne's new lover. Marvel Girl fought against Madelyne.Cyclops defeated Havok, and Marvel Girl managed to defeat the Goblin Queen. As Madelyne lay dying in Marvel Girl's arms, she passed all of her memories and parts of the Phoenix Force into Marvel Girl's mind. Madelyne's memories informed Marvel Girl of who had been the real mastermind behind her existence. Mr. Sinister had cloned Jean, but the clone remained lifeless. After the Phoenix died on the moon, the Force approached the lifeless body of Jean Grey on the floor of Jamaica Bay. When Jean unconsciously rejected the Phoenix it found another host, the body of Jean's clone.When the Phoenix animated the clone's body, Sinister implanted her with false memories and gave her the name Madelyne Pryor. He then placed her in Alaska, where she was guaranteed to meet and become romantically involved with Cyclops. However, Madelyne retained the Phoenix's replicated telepathic and telekinetic abilities. Madelyne hadn't realized it, but for years she had been using her powers on a subconscious level. She had even been the actual cause of Cyclops' surprising defeat when Storm challenged him for leadership of the X-Men. However, without the same experience Jean Grey had, Madelyne slowly became corrupted by her powers. Marvel Girl led the X-Men and X-Factor to the site of the Xavier Institute where they confronted Mr. Sinister for the first time.However, Cyclops was unable to face Sinister. When he was still a boy living at the orphanage, Mr. Sinister had planted mental blocks inside of Cyclops' mind. Therefore, he was unable to help while Sinister defeated the X-Men and X-Factor. With the stress of the situation mounting, Cyclops worked to overcome Sinister's mental blocks. With Marvel Girl's help, and Havok using his powers to overcharge him, Cyclops was finally able to use his optic blasts on Sinister. It was the first successful strike against Sinister, as he was unable to adapt to the blasts. Cyclops unleashed an extremely powerful attack, blasting Sinister's body to pieces. Though he had finally defeated his childhood tormentor, it would not be the last time Cyclops saw Sinister.</hero:storyDescription>

Aside from Beast and Rogue, the team included members that Cyclops had either struggled to cooperate with in the past or had never worked with before. Wolverine and Cyclops rarely saw eye to eye due to Cyclops' leadership and their mutual attraction to Jean Grey. Gambit was a natural loner, who often worked towards his own agenda. Jubilee was still very young, and relatively inexperienced in action.Psylocke had been through many life-changing experiences since Cyclops first met her, and the two soon became attracted to one another. Psylocke was open about her flirtation with Cyclops, who tried to deny his attraction to her.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">As they were enjoying a relaxing cup of coffee, Jean caught Cyclops daydreaming about Psylocke. As he was reassuring her that it was nothing, they were ambushed by Caliban and kidnapped before any of the other X-Men could do anything to help. Meanwhile, Stryfe had disguised himself as Cable and shot Professor Xavier with a techno-organic bullet at a peace rally in Central Park. The X-Men divided their resources between working to save the Professor, tracking down Cable, and investigating the whereabouts of their missing friends. They captured X-Force, fought the Mutant Liberation Front, Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and Dark Riders, before teaming up with Apocalypse to uncover who had orchestrated several attacks at once.It transpired that Cyclops and Jean Grey had been kidnapped by Stryfe. They struggled to break free from their cell and escape the high-tech base. They were recaptured and placed into solitary confinement where they were prodded by mechanical torture devices. On one of their attempts to escape they came across a baby who resembled Nathan Christopher when he was infected with the techno-organic virus. The baby was connected to the base's computers and wired to detonate. Sadly, Jean found out that the baby would die if they separated it from the machine.Stryfe was convinced that the two would kill the baby in order to save themselves, but Cyclops and Jean refused to harm the child. Confused, Stryfe removed the baby, and soon Cyclops and Jean managed to escape. However, when they got outside they found themselves trapped in a small pocket of air located on the surface of the moon. Bishop, Cable, and Wolverine tracked Stryfe down. However, Stryfe had created a force field that prevented anyone from entering, unless they had either Summers or Grey genetics.While the other X-Men waited outside of the force field, Cable and Havok continued onwards to stop Stryfe. When they reached Stryfe, his plans were finally revealed. Stryfe believed that he was Nathan Christopher Summers, and had been abandoned in the future where he was raised by cold and unloving machines. For this, he sought revenge on Scott and Jean, who he believed were his biological parents.However, Stryfe had been wrong. He was not Nathan, but instead a clone of the techno-organic infected baby. It was revealed that Cable was in fact Cyclops' son Nathan Christopher, back from the future. Stryfe opened a powerful vortex with the intent to kill everyone. Cable jumped into the vortex and began fighting against Stryfe.In the ensuing struggle between Cable and his clone, Stryfe was seemingly killed; but not before he managed to unleash the extremely deadly Legacy Virus into the Earth's atmosphere. Cable appeared to drag the destructive power of the vortex forwards through time, saving everyone. Cyclops had finally been reunited with his son, only to lose him to the future once again.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">It had been years since the death of Madelyne Pryor. Scott and Jean had been through a lot as a couple, and had nearly lost each other on several occasions. They decided that the time was right for them to get married, before anything else could happen to them. The date was set, the invitations went out, and Scott and Jean arranged for a priest to perform the ceremony at the mansion. Storm used her powers to ensure that the weather would be suitably warm and bright for the wedding ceremony.Surrounded by their many friends and family, long-time lovers Scott Summers and Jean Grey were married. At long last, Jean Grey had finally become Jean Grey-Summers. Unfortunately, the instant they left the safe confines of the mansion, Cyclops and Jean were snatched away. This time, they were dragged thousands of years into the future. They found themselves inhabiting bodies that had been created for their psychic consciousnesses, that could reproduce their own powers. They were finally reunited with the baby boy who they thought they would never see again. As Redd and Slym Dayspring, Jean and Cyclops were given the chance to raise Nathan Christopher Summers, otherwise known as Askani'son.Redd and Slym lived in the future with the Askani'son for twelve years. During that time they cared for him, helped educate him, and kept him safe from the clutches of Apocalypse and his forces. Askani'son had a clone who was created as a means to deceive and slow down Apocalypse. This clone, who would one day become Stryfe, was snatched away by Apocalypse and raised to become his heir.Apocalypse later tried to shift his life-force into the child's body, but as a result he realized that he was a clone and not the actual Askani'son. Apocalypse then rejected the boy. This led to the anger and resentment that caused Stryfe to later kidnap Scott and Jean.After twelve years had passed, and Askani'son had grown, Redd and Slym bid their son a tearful farewell. Rachel Summers became the elderly woman known as "Mother Askani", and established the Askani religion in order to help raise her half-brother. Rachel summoned the power to send her biological parents back into the past, but as she did so she urged Jean to take on the name Phoenix.Cyclops and Phoenix were forced to leave their son once again, with their minds being returned back to their real bodies in the present day. They discovered themselves lying on a beach, dressed in strange uniforms. There, they had to aid an elderly woman. They encountered Mr. Sinister, who informed Cyclops that he had another brother. Once they had successfully helped the old lady, they were free to enjoy the exotic island for the remainder of their honeymoon.</hero:storyDescription>

In order to protect Nate, Cyclops merged with Apocalypse, thereby becoming his new host body. Cyclops was considered to have died in action.However, neither Phoenix nor Cable gave up on him. They tracked down Apocalypse, and confronted him in Egypt. In the ensuing battle they were able to separate Apocalypse from Cyclops' body, destroying Apocalypse's spirit. Cyclops was haunted by the experience of being merged with Apocalypse and began to question his life, relationships, and how he had handled situations with the X-Men. Cyclops displayed a much more ruthless personality, and began going on more missions with Wolverine (who he started to form an unlikely friendship with).</hero:storyDescription>

The X-Men continued operating from the mansion. Cyclops performed both administrative and liaison duties for the school, on top of leading the X-Men out in the field. However, Cyclops' behavior had noticeably changed as he became more stoic.While on the way back from a mission in Australia, to retrieve the mutant Ugly John, Wolverine and Cyclops encountered a new breed of Sentinel. The Sentinels were under the control of Cassandra Nova, Professor Xavier's evil twin sister. Cyclops and Wolverine crash their plane and are left stranded.Cyclops commands Wolverine to watch over John, but they are soon ambushed and held prisoner by Nova's new Sentinels. Although Cyclops manages to fight against Nova, John is dying in immense pain after being tortured. Cyclops puts John out of his misery with an optic blast.Sentinels under Nova's control attack Magneto's sovereign nation of Genosha, massacring sixteen million mutants. Beast and Jean go to assist with the relief work, discovering that Emma Frost is among the survivors due to the activation of her secondary mutation (an organic diamond form). Upon their return to the mansion, the X-Men come under direct attack from Cassandra Nova. As Professor Xavier's genetic twin, Nova possessed immense telepathic powers.Nova manages to disable Cyclops by feeding off his insecurities and telepathically placing his mind in a "black bug room" inhabited by giant talking cockroaches. Cyclops eventually snaps out of the illusion and Nova is seemingly defeated by Xavier and Emma. Cyclops chooses to keep his distance from Jean, feeling confused and unable to express his troubles. Jean's deepening connection to the Phoenix Force further distanced her, as her emotions became more influenced by it's power.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Cyclops continued to keep his distance from Jean, who respected his wish for celibacy. Professor X had left the institute and gone into space (his body under the control of Cassandra Nova) to be with the Shi'ar Empress Lilandra, leaving Phoenix as headmistress of the Institute. Cyclops began to feel neglected, and didn't feel like he could communicate with Jean. He sought the help of Emma Frost, and the two engaged in a series of psychic "therapy sessions" to help him get through his frustrations.Emma took advantage of this situation in order to get closer to Cyclops. While in Hong Kong, investigating mutant deaths caused by the U-Men, Scott and Emma spent the night drinking champagne together. They started a telepathic affair, without any physical contact. The relationship was sexual in nature, appearing to revolve around Cyclops' varied fantasies about his wife. Although Emma was manipulating a confused Scott into continuing the affair, she eventually realized that she'd fallen in love with him.As the affair was psychic in nature, Scott and Emma would often be in contact while in the company of their teammates. Even while out on missions, Cyclops would find himself maintaining mental contact with Emma. Phoenix questioned Cyclops directly about whether anything had happened in Hong Kong. His response was stoic, telling her that Emma kept him up the entire night. As a teacher at the Xavier Institute, Emma continued to closely monitor her five telepathic students, the Stepford Cuckoos.The girls had discovered Emma's affair with Cyclops, and were angry with their mentor after the death of their sister, Sophie. They led Phoenix into the mansion garden, where Cyclops and Emma were telepathically engaged together. Phoenix entered Cyclops' mind without permission where she found Cyclops embracing Emma, who was dressed as the Dark Phoenix. An enraged Phoenix telepathically attacked Emma without mercy.Furious, Cyclops demanded that Jean read his mind and look at the memories of the night he spent with Emma in Hong Kong. Phoenix saw that Cyclops had not been physically intimate with Emma, though she was still angry about their mental affair. Cyclops then abruptly leaves on Wolverine's motorcycle.</hero:storyDescription>

Surprisingly, Scott seemed to admit that this theory was the truth of the matter, further admitting that he had even blocked making the decision out of his memory to preserve the fallacy in his own mind and prevent others from discovering the truth.Scott apparently enters into a catatonic state, with his eyes uncovered and displaying their natural shade of brown, with no evidence of his powers manifesting.

The team also finds many dead Marauders and Purifiers, and discover that a fight had been waged over possession of the mutant: a newborn baby. Cyclops sends out Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Angel, and Colossus to find former Acolytes in order to gain information on the Marauders.Xavier argues with Cyclops on this, demanding to know why Cyclops didn't inform him about the team. Cyclops makes it clear to Xavier that he doesn't need his permission to lead the X-Men. When Professor X continues to argue, Cyclops brings up Xavier's track record of morally dubious decisions. Cyclops calls in X-Factor to help with the situation, asking Rictor to infiltrate the Purifiers as he was de-powered after M-Day, as well as asking Madrox and Layla Miller to go see Forge.Upon discovering that Cable has taken the newborn mutant, Cyclops orders the reforming of X-Force with Wolverine leading the team. Their first mission is to hunt down Cable and retrieve the baby at any cost. Professor X confronts Cyclops on his leadership, questioning his decision to send a team of killers after his own son.

After finding the Marauders' hideout on Muir Island, Cyclops dispatches X-Force and Bishop to go there and retrieve the baby (whom the Marauders had captured).During the final battle, Cyclops sends the New X-Men up against the Marauders, believing that Sinister's forces will be caught off-guard by unfamiliar opponents. The students prove to be effective. Cyclops then confronts Cable, demanding he hand over the baby. Cable, with a gun pointed at his father, begs Cyclops to let him escape into the future with the baby so that she can make her own decisions instead of having them forced upon her. Cable gives the child to Cyclops, however, after Professor Xavier points out that the future of all mutant-kind is at stake and Cyclops, as leader of the X-Men, must speak for all of mutants.Cyclops holds the baby and realizes that she deserves the chance to make her own destiny. Cyclops gives the girl back to Cable, telling him to raise her in the future away from those who would use her for their own agendas. Cable teleports to the future, just as Bishop fires at him. The shot misses and hits Professor X in the head, apparently killing him. Cyclops takes out Bishop with a blast and as the X-Men all gather around Xavier's body, Cyclops declares them disbanded.

Norman defeats Cyclops in personal combat, and appears ready to kill the mutant leader. However, this all turns out to be part of Cyclops' plan. News cameras swarm all over Osborn, as he soon realizes that his forces have been defeated by the X-Men thanks to Cyclops' superior strategy. Osborn is then forced to retreat, leaving Utopia. Cyclops speaks to the camera crews, announcing the autonomy of the mutant race and sovereignty of Utopia.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Magneto arrives on Utopia, having regained his mutant powers with the help of the High Evolutionary. The "Master of Magnetism" proclaims his respect for Cyclops' achievement in uniting mutantkind. Professor X assaults Magneto telepathically, unwilling to believe that his "old friend" is sincere in his attempts to make peace with the X-Men. Cyclops orders Charles to stand down, and later cautiously accepts Magneto as an X-Man.Cyclops later accepts Professor X's help in telepathically linking him with Emma's mind, in an attempt to free her from the sliver of the Void which remained inside her after she defeated the Sentry. Inside Emma's mind, Cyclops finds a white room filled with various diamond figures, each representing a different aspect of her psyche. Emma's main consciousness approaches Cyclops, but as they begin discussing how to extract the Void all of the other aspects of Emma attack.Realizing that the figures are not actually a part of Emma's mind, Cyclops attacks back by using a mental version of his optic blast. The blast acts as a beacon to Emma, who finds Cyclops again. However, the Void has plans of its own and moves to possess Cyclops. Emma is ejected from the telepathic link and back into the physical world (now able to leave her diamond form), while Cyclops remains unconscious. Emma reveals that the Void has passed from her to Cyclops. Cyclops sits among the remains of the destroyed mansion, with a black mass hidden among the rubble.He is confronted by shadowy female figures who ask him why he didn't save them, and tell him he will never be the man he wants to be unless he lets the Void in. Emma appears on the scene and destroys the figures. She and Cyclops attempt to leave, but the Void grabs Cyclops and separates him from Emma. In the physical world Scott screams in pain and Professor X tells Psylocke that if Cyclops wakes up before Emma, the Void has taken over him and that she must kill him.In the meantime, the Void is still trying to convince Scott to let it take control. Scott responds by shooting it with his optic blast. He is then seen in a white room which Emma cannot enter. Since they are in Scott's mind, he is in control. He makes it so that Emma cannot enter the room, much to her dismay, and tells her to trust him. The door of the room closes in front of Emma, who wakes up.Psylocke is about to kill Scott, but Emma tells her to give him a chance. Scott sits on the ground with a black box in front of him, and the Void starts to engulf him. He holds up the box, and suddenly the Void is trapped inside. Cyclops tells the Void that he had been in a relationship with an extremely powerful telepath for years, and she taught him how to defend his mind. Scott wakes up to a relieved Emma, having trapped the Void in his mind.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Ever since Cable's departure into the future; Scott has been doing his best to protect him and Hope from danger while he awaits their return. Cyclops is shown to have enormous faith in the fact that Hope will not only return, but that she will be the savior of the mutant race. When he receives news that Cable and Hope may have returned, Cyclops sends his alpha team out while he coordinates their movements from Utopia. When X-Force is outed, he gets some backlash from Nightcrawler. As time goes on, Cyclops' tactics are being tested as some of the X-Men begin to question his leadership.With the X-Men suffering many injuries as well as two deaths (including Nightcrawler), Scott comes under fire with people questioning whether or not Hope is worth it. After Donald Pierce decimates all the X-Men's jets and the Blackbirds, Cyclops kills him with a powerful optic blast. They realize that Bastion is trying to prevent them from leaving. Suddenly, a red dome encapsulates all of San Francisco.The X-Men discover the center of the dome on the Golden Gate bridge. When the team arrives, they are shocked to find Nimrods exiting from the small sphere. It takes all of their efforts to destroy the Nimrods, with many injured. After regrouping, Cyclops leaves a team on the bridge in case more Nimrods come through. During a council meeting, Prodigy reveals he has calculated how many Nimrods are likely to come through the portal. He lost count at 170,000. Outside the dome, Avengers from New York have gathered in an attempt to take down the dome from the outside. Cyclops gives many of the X-Men jobs for what they should be doing around the area to prepare.It is decided that Cable will use his last time jump to take X-Force and Cypher into the future to stop the Nimrods at their source. Hope says goodbye to Nathan, her adoptive father and the only person she has in the world. After X-Force departs Cyclops, laments to Emma that it's a suicide mission and he has just sent the team, including his own son, to their deaths. Hope becomes furious, screaming that she hates Cyclops before running off. Cyclops notices that she was manifesting his glowing red eyes.The Nimrods emerge from the portal, and battle ensues. Eventually, Cypher manages to stop the Nimrods at their source. X-Force are unable to go through the portal, as it only works for non-organic beings. Cable sacrifices himself, finally letting the techno-organic virus take hold of his body. This allows him to hold the portal open while the rest of the team goes through. Cable dies with a smile on his face after seeing Hope one last time, his body seemingly exploding and leaving only his cybernetic left arm behind.With no time to grieve for Cable's death, the X-Men defend themselves against Bastion as he attacks with the remainder of his forces. Hope, distraught at all that has happened, attacks Bastion and her true powers manifest. She proves to be an Omega-level mutant, capable of mimicking the powers of all mutants in her vicinity. Hope easily defeats Bastion with assistance from Cyclops, and Wolverine delivers the killing blow to avenge the death of Nightcrawler. With Bastion's death, the dome falls and Hope is shown levitating in front of Cyclops and the X-Men like the Phoenix. The messiah of the mutant race has risen.</hero:storyDescription>

When Cyclops attempts to read the eulogy for his son, he breaks down into tears. Hope then delivers a eulogy herself on Nathan's life as a soldier, stating that he died fighting for what he believed in. Hope later expresses great interest in discovering her biological family. Cyclops goes to the Savage Land to get a work out away from the world, and is found by Steve Rogers.Steve tells Scott that it is time for the X-Men be recognized by the public for the heroes that they are. Steve has Cyclops receive a presidential medal for all he has accomplished as leader of the X-Men. After receiving the medal, Scott finds Hope sitting by the ocean and begins trying to work through her issues with him. He tosses his medal into the ocean and tells Hope that he won't control her life, and that he will allow her to seek out her biological family.Cannonball gives Cyclops a report of his team, telling him that the team is broken and that he cannot lead them. He says that the Hodge mission was a failure, because Karma lost her leg and Warlock was forced to kill sentient life. Cyclops tells Cannonball that if his team is broken, then he needs to fix it. Meanwhile, Emma witnesses Hope manifesting the Phoenix and rushes to tell Scott. With the commotion over this, Cyclops finds that Cerebra has located five new mutants across the globe.

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Cyclops, accompanied by Wolverine, delivers a speech at the United Nations where he reveals that he is aware of each country having a supply of sentinels. He asks that the world leaders dismantle all sentinels in their nations to better improve relations with the mutant race.Just then, Quentin Quire arrives to unleash a telepathic attack. Cyclops and Wolverine are left unaffected due to their psychic defenses, but the world leaders in the room begin shouting out embarrassing secrets about themselves on national television.After this, a battalion of sentinels are unleashed with orders to track down and detain a male mutant. Fitting this basic description, Cyclops and Wolverine are attacked, but are able to easily defeat the sentinels. Quentin addresses the world on television, relaying his ideology of mutant liberation against humanity. Later, the nations of the world begin to unleash their sentinels for fear of any more mutant attacks.Cyclops makes the call to place mutants on high alert, with Storm believing that they shouldn't cause panic. Cyclops stays pragmatic, stating that they must be cautious with so many people taking up arms against mutants. Wolverine becomes wary when Cyclops allows Idie to watch the newscast of the sentinels, but Cyclops feels that it is important for her to understand that the world fears and hates her for being born a mutant. The sentinels of various nations begin to malfunction.Later, Quentin arrives on Utopia seeking asylum. An enraged Wolverine demands that they hand Quentin over to Steve Rogers. Cyclops insists that they should deal with Quire themselves, further angering Wolverine. Meanwhile, Kade Kilgore, a psychotic child prodigy and billionaire, has been named the new "Black King" of the Hellfire Club. It turns out he is responsible for Quentin Quire's attack on the UN, and he plans to wipe out the mutant race for profit. Cyclops sends X-Men teams around the world to deal with the many sentinels.At the unveiling of a new mutant museum in San Francisco, Cyclops has sent his "A-team" consisting of Emma Frost, Magneto, Namor, Colossus, and Iceman to improve the public appearance of the X-Men and the mutant race in general. Cyclops watches from his command at Utopia, and Wolverine watches from a bar. Kade and his Hellfire team attack the museum, successfully incapacitating the entire team of X-Men utilizing their superior knowledge and advanced technology. Only young Idie is left unscathed.Cyclops and Wolverine both race to the museum. Idie gets into telepathic contact with them to reveal that she has remained unnoticed and that the Hellfire terrorists have a bomb. Wolverine urges Idie to escape, and that he can make it to the museum. Cyclops realizes neither he nor Wolverine will get there in time, and tells Idie do what she feels she must. Idie defeats the Hellfire soldiers and save the civilians before the bomb goes off. Cyclops and Wolverine arrive just in time to help the civilians to safety as the bomb explodes. Wolverine displays his anger to Cyclops for allowing Idie to take matters into her own hands, but Cyclops stands by his decision seeing that Idie saved all of the civilians.They both soon realize, however, that the bomb the Hellfire Club left was an electromagnetic device that was using the metal in the area to create a new kind of gigantic sentinel. Cyclops escorts Idie back to Utopia while Madison Jeffries, Dr. Nemesis, and Wolverine attempt to deal with the sentinel. Their efforts fail, however, and the sentinel makes its way towards Utopia. With most of the X-Men scattered around the globe, Cyclops is left alone to defend his nation. He realizes that this was all planned out, and blasts the sentinel. The sentinel keeps coming despite Cyclops' efforts, and he alerts everyone on Utopia to brace themselves for an attack.Hope comes to assist Cyclops, accompanied by her Five Lights and some of the Young X-Men. Cyclops rallies them together to fight the approaching sentinel, but Wolverine arrives and demands that they all be sent away due to their ages. Cyclops believes that, despite their youth, they are still capable of defending Utopia. Wolverine continues to argue with Cyclops, insisting that Utopia be evacuated instead. Hope and the others choose to remain and fight alongside Cyclops. This prompts Wolverine to arm 2000 pounds of plastic explosives, from his personal stash, in an attempt to force an evacuation and destroy the sentinel.The young mutants rush to alert everyone, while Cyclops stays behind to face Wolverine. The two X-Men argue about detonating the bombs, with both refusing to back down. Ultimately, this leads to a brutal fight over the remote to the explosives. All the while, the sentinel looms overhead trying to kill them both. The fight is broken up when Hope and the other students start fighting the sentinel.Cyclops and Wolverine put their differences aside and help defeat the sentinel. While Utopia is recovering from the attack, Wolverine reveals to Cyclops that he plans to leave Utopia, along with any X-Men that will come with him. Although he believes that Wolverine is making a mistake, Cyclops allows him to leave. Wolverine goes to Westchester, planning to start a new school for training young mutants. Kitty Pryde and Beast are among the faculty, while Idie and Quentin Quire are among the students. Cyclops and the X-Men that remain loyal to his cause, including Emma, Magneto, Namor, and Hope, remain on Utopia.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Cyclops forms a powerful group of X-Men that he dubs the "Extinction Team". The goal he sets for them is to prove that they are "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", changing public perception of mutants into something the world needs to survive. They will also act as a deterrent against attacks on mutants (including those at Wolverine's new school). The team consists of Storm, Emma Frost, Magneto, Namor, Colossus, Danger, Magik, and Hope Summers. Their first mission is to deal with the resurrected Mr. Sinister and his plans with the Dreaming Celestial.Sinister departs in the Celestial's head (altered to resemble his face) shortly after the team arrives on the scene, leaving them to fight with the many "micro-celestials" that it's body is disintegrating into. Magneto acts as a surrogate "nervous system" for the Celestial's body: piecing it back together, though he is exhausting himself by doing so. After losing a diamond arm in the battle, Emma is forced to remain in her diamond form, unable to use her telepathy. Meanwhile, Sinister flies the Celestial's head to San Francisco's Fine Arts museum to further his plan.Sinister utilizes the Celestial's cosmic power to release a massive amount of energy that reconstructs the museum into his own "Sinister World's-Fair", filled with clones of himself. Cyclops is contacted by Abigail Brand, who informs him that the Celestials are coming to Earth. As the team battles against Mr. Sinister's clones, he proposes a cease fire and invites them into the museum to speak with him. The team senses a trap and prepare themselves, with Emma and Hope devising a trump card. Sinister reveals his plan for the Celestials to wipe out humanity, with the mutant race fighting his new "Sinister" species for supremacy of Earth.Sinister telepathically takes control of the team, but Emma is immune in her diamond form. Using a code word, Emma frees Hope from Sinister's control and she shoots him through the head. Sinister predicted this would happen, and as the team regains control of their minds they realize Sinister exists as a hive mind through his clones. Danger takes down all of the Sinister clones inside the palace, and the team goes to face Sinister outside.Sinister reveals that he is using Cyclops' mind as a blueprint for his new species. Emma abandons her diamond form and, using her intimate knowledge of Cyclops' mind, psionically defeats Sinister. Sinister appears in a new body, revealing that he has adapted from the weaknesses of his previous form. The Dreaming Celestial's head returns to its body as Sinister levitates the museum away. Before shooting himself in the head, Sinister tells Scott that he will lose everything he cares about.Magneto summons the team as the Celestials land, and Cyclops calls out to them. He claims that his new team protect the planet and all of it's residents, including the Dreaming Celestial. The Celestials leave the planet without issue after the Dreaming Celestial points its finger to the sky in support of the X-Men. A number of awestruck civilians arrive on the scene. The crowd refrains from throwing bricks, shouting racial slurs or anything anti-mutant in nature. Cyclops' plan for ensuring mutant survival through fear appears to be working.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The Phoenix Force is heading towards Earth, devouring entire planets in its path. The Avengers wish to stop it, fearing that it will destroy the Earth. Cyclops believes it to be a force of rebirth that will bond with the mutant messiah Hope Summers to restore the mutant population. Captain America arrives on Utopia, backed by a helicarrier full of Avengers, and demands that Cyclops allow him to take Hope into protective custody. Cyclops refuses, blasting Cap into the ocean. With this, the X-Men and the Avengers go to war over the fate of Hope and the Phoenix.While the two teams of heroes battle, Hope escapes from Utopia as she begins to manifest the powers of the Phoenix. Cyclops feigns defeat to the Avengers, escaping Utopia with his Extinction Team and other X-Men. The race is on to find Hope, who uses skills Cable taught her in order to hide her location. The X-Men and Avengers fight all across the globe as they search, with some of the faculty from the Jean Grey School joining Cyclops' ranks. Emma manages to finally locate Hope after reading Cap's mind.Hope has made her way to the Blue Area of the Moon, and is planning to become the host of the Phoenix in order to fulfill her destiny and bring about the rebirth of the mutant race. She has recruited Wolverine to help her, but he betrays their location to the Avengers in an attempt to protect her. Cyclops and his team arrive just after the Avengers, and a fierce fight ensues. During the battle, a beaten Thor falls from the sky, revealing that the Phoenix has arrived. It begins to bond with Hope, who struggles to control it's power. She begs Wolverine to kill her, as he had previously promised.Cyclops blasts Wolverine, unwilling to let Hope be killed before she can fulfill her destiny and save the mutant race. He declares his belief in her, and that the Avengers are impeding her destiny as the messiah of mutantkind.Iron Man uses a giant powered suit he designed with Hank Pym in an attempt to stop the Phoenix Force, attacking it just as it is bonding with Hope. The Phoenix is unexpectedly broken into five shards, causing Cyclops, Emma, Magik, Colossus, and Namor to become possessed. Cyclops is angered, declaring that the Avengers have interfered with the Phoenix's plan to gift Hope with it's power, and as a result the will of the Phoenix must be done by them.After effortlessly defeating the Avengers, the Phoenix Five take Hope back to Earth with them with the intention of preparing her for what is to come. The Phoenix Five, desiring to make Earth a better place for mutants, rebuild Utopia as a sprawling metropolis in the sky. Professor X visits and has a discussion with Cyclops, who proclaims to his mentor and father-figure that he has fulfilled Xavier's dream of a world where mutants and human can coexist in peace.Cyclops and the Phoenix Five use their new god-like powers in an attempt to bring world peace. They end starvation, provide unlimited energy sources, and outlaw warfare by declaring "Pax Utopia" before the United Nations. Later, while he is speaking with Hope on Utopia, Cyclops tempts her with the Phoenix as a means of questioning why she rejected it's power. He states that she is not deserving of the Phoenix, as a child like her could never understand what needs to be done.The Avengers, wary of the unchecked power the Phoenix Five possess, infiltrate Utopia on orders from the President in an attempt to capture Hope (who they believe is the key to stopping the Phoenix Force). They are faced with Cyclops and Emma, but escape due to the arrival of the Scarlet Witch. Hope agrees to leave with the Scarlet Witch and the Avengers, despite Cyclops' protests. A connection between the Scarlet Witch's powers and the Phoenix is revealed when Cyclops is harmed while attempting to stop her before she teleports away with Hope.Cyclops states that although the X-Men try to help people, mutants will always be hunted and ostracized by humanity. He says that the humans will always try and send their "heroes" to attack them, despite all the good that they have done. Cyclops declares that this will not be tolerated any longer, and simply says "No more Avengers." Making good on his word, Cyclops has all the Avengers systematically hunted down and imprisoned. Magik uses Limbo as a prison for the captured heroes..While hunting the Avengers, Magik encounters the Scarlet Witch. She nearly defeats Magik before Emma arrives and attacks. Hawkeye then attacks Emma so that the Avengers can escape, and is burnt nearly to death by her in retaliation. Cyclops chastises Emma for this, believing that they should not use lethal force to prove their point, and uses his powers to heal Hawkeye. While fighting the Avengers, the young mutant Transonic is captured and Namor is left shocked after he is attacked by the Scarlet Witch. Cyclops wishes to bide his time in rooting out the Avengers, which infuriates Namor. Emma then manipulates Namor by revealing to him that she has psychically tracked the Avengers to Wakanda, and that she hasn't told Scott.Namor invades Wakanda with an army of Atlanteans, seeking to destroy the Avengers once and for all. Magneto brings Namor's whereabouts to Cyclops' attention. Scott is angered by Namor's recklessness, and questions Emma as to what she knows about it. Emma dodges the question by simply stating that Namor is his own mutant, and that Scott was fooling himself if he thought otherwise. Cyclops orders the team to depart for Wakanda immediately, to Emma's displeasure.When they arrive, Namor is defeated by the power of the Scarlet Witch. Surprisingly, his share of the Phoenix Force leaves him and is then split amongst the remaining avatars. Xavier telepathically speaks with Scott, upset over what has happened. Cyclops asks him to join them, but Xavier refuses and asks Cyclops to stop what he is doing. He states that although he loves Scott, he will stop the Phoenix Five if he has to. Scott tells Xavier that he lost the right to tell him what to do, removing him from his mind. The team then silently observe the devastation Namor has caused.Cyclops meets with Emma in the Danakil Desert in Ethiopia (the most inhospitable place on Earth). Emma is very concerned about the Phoenix's power corrupting her, and states that part of her wishes to end the conflict with the Avengers by simply switching off their minds. Cyclops is worried that she is sounding like Namor, and that the Avengers are trying to paint them as villains.Emma reveals to him that she has reached into every mind on the planet, and has found Hope in the mystical city of K'un-Lun. Cyclops immediately flies away, unaware that Emma is begging for him to stop her as the Phoenix further corrupts her.Colossus and Magik both fall as they attempt to gain each other's power, due to manipulation by Spider-Man. This causes their portions of the Phoenix Force to be absorbed by Cyclops and Emma. Cyclops rips open the dimensional barrier between Earth and K'un-Lun, where he tells Hope that it is now time to come home. Cyclops battles with all the remaining Avengers, easily defeating them as he pursues Hope. Hope manages to attack Cyclops, sending him to the moon, after copying the Scarlet Witch's chaos magic and absorbing some of the Iron Fist's chi.Realizing he is in need of more power, Cyclops goes to find Emma as The Watcher observes. Scott returns to Utopia, but cannot bring himself to attack Emma. She knows that he is thinking about possibly taking her power, and begins to lose control as she talks about burning the world and remaking it in their image. This greatly concerns Cyclops, who feels they are falling. Xavier telepathically invades Cyclops' mind, forcing him into an illusion as the Avengers have him bound. Xavier attempts to shut him down, but Emma intervenes as they begin to fight off the combined forces of the Avengers and the X-Men.As the attacks get worse, and more people Cyclops thought he could trust appear fighting on the side of the Avengers, he grows desperate. In a psychic meeting with Emma, while their bodies' fight, Cyclops is told by a guilt-ridden Emma that she engaged in a psychic affair with Namor while he attacked Wakanda. She apologizes and tells Scott that she truly loves him, going on to say that she wouldn't care if the two of them burned the world around them, as a queen of ashes is still a queen. Realizing that they are losing touch with their humanity, Cyclops states he will finish things himself. He asks Emma to forgive him, defeating her and taking her half of the Phoenix.Now possessing the Phoenix's full power, Cyclops strikes down Xavier as he attempts to stop his surrogate son. With tears in his eyes, Cyclops despairingly shouts to Captain America that he forced him to this. He then makes the transformation into the "Dark Phoenix". Cyclops then go on a rampage, attempting to burn away the entire world and create a new one from the ashes for mutantkind to prosper. The Avengers and X-Men combine their efforts to stop him, but his power is too great. Wanda and Hope combine their powers to attack Scott, as he gains control for a brief moment and begs to be killed.Scott then sees a vision of Jean Grey, and she compels him to let go of the Phoenix. Wanda and Hope strike Cyclops with a final blow as he releases the power. Hope absorbs the Phoenix, using it to repair the damage Cyclops has done around the world. She combines her efforts with the Scarlet Witch, saying "No more Phoenix" as the entity disappears. Guilt-ridden over all that has happened, Scott chooses to accept full responsibility for everyone's actions despite the circumstances with the Phoenix.Imprisoned, Cyclops is informed by Beast that Hope harnessing the Phoenix has caused the rebirth of the mutant race. Scott is vindicated by this, admitting that while he is repentant for Xavier's death (and wishes he had died instead) and for all the damage he has caused, he would do it all again to bring mutants back. He is then placed in a ruby quartz prison by SHIELD, while his "Extinction Team" become renegades on the run from the Avengers. Magneto and Magik evade capture, but Emma is detained by the Avengers.Cyclops is later visited by Captain America. Scott reaffirms his wish to be the one held solely accountable for everything that happened, and that Cap should leave the rest of the X-Men alone. Cap confirms that new mutants have begun to appear across the globe, which Cyclops sees as a victory. This infuriates Cap, who accuses Cyclops of starting the war and endangering the planet. Cyclops is undeterred, however, believing that a "new age" will begin for both the Avengers and the X-Men.Cap confirms that Cyclops was right in at least one aspect: that the Avengers hadn't done enough to help mutantkind, which is now going to change. Cyclops is then left contemplating the nature of the Phoenix, and it's cycle of destruction and rebirth.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Cyclops is transferred from his SHIELD prison cell to a private sector prison, which is testing new anti-mutant technology in the wake of the mutant resurgence. Believing that Cyclops may be able to convince the remaining members of the "Extinction Team" to come out of hiding, Captain America asks Wolverine to go speak to him. A reluctant Wolverine arrives, six-pack of beer in hand, to settle things with Cyclops. They discuss the death of Professor Xavier, which Cyclops still deeply regrets, and the path that Cyclops has chosen to take.Cyclops claims that he only did what he believed had to be done, and that Wolverine of all people should understand that. He then accuses Wolverine of nearly ruining everything by attempting to kill Hope, before stating that he now knows how Jean felt in a way that Wolverine will never understand. Enraged, Wolverine nearly stabs Cyclops, before realizing that is exactly what he wants.Cyclops admits his desire to become a martyr, and that it would be best for Wolverine to be the one to kill him. This revelation ruins Wolverine's desire to kill him, however. Wolverine attempts to convince Cyclops to help them bring in the remaining members of his X-Men, but leaves in anger when Cyclops asks to know where Emma and Hope are.While working in the machine shop Cyclops meets his cell neighbor, a young mutant prisoner named Jake whose power had just recently manifested. A trio of large, mutant-hating prisoners then approach, seemingly about to give Cyclops the martyrdom he seeks. However, when they refuse to leave Jake alone, Cyclops easily defeats all three in hand-to-hand combat.He later tells Jake about the Jean Grey School, and how they could help train him in the use of his new mutant power. Using metal filings gathered from the machine shop, Cyclops creates secret messages to communicate with Magneto. He asks Scott if he wishes to be broken out, but Scott refuses as he wants to remain a political prisoner rather than become a common criminal. Cyclops later accepts Tony Stark's request to run to some tests on him in the hopes of understanding the Phoenix better, only agreeing after Stark admits that he knew the Phoenix would create more mutants.After getting an X tattooed on his arm, Jake is stabbed by one of the mutant-hating prisoners Cyclops had previously beaten. Wolverine visits Cyclops' cell later to inform him of Jake's death. Logan attempts to talk Cyclops down, admitting that he believes Cyclops had never intended to kill Xavier and that that he'd secretly looked up to him as a role model alongside the Professor on how to be a better man. Cyclops is undeterred, however, choosing to continue on his new path. He contacts Magneto again, letting him know he is now ready to be freed.Magneto, Magik, and Danger stage a massive assault on the prison, freeing Cyclops as well as many of the other prisoners in the process. The trio of mutant-hating inmates are banished to Limbo by Magik. The prison warden, who Cyclops accuses of attempting to profit from mutant misery, has an X scarred across his face by Danger at Cyclops' request. When the Avengers arrive on scene to round up all of the escaped prisoners, Wolverine discovers that Cyclops has left a note for him with the disfigured warden.In the note, Cyclops states that the Jean Grey School now has his full blessing and that he knows Wolverine will do his best to teach mutants as Professor X had. He believes that Wolverine is the "better man" now, so he must fill the void by becoming the man who "does what need to be done" and protect mutantkind by any means necessary. Leading the remnants of the Extinction Team, Cyclops affirms his belief that they're still doing what the X-Men have always done: saving a world that fears and hates them.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Free from imprisonment, Cyclops begins his quest for redemption and becomes the face of a new mutant revolution. Alongside Magik and Magneto, he creates a new Xavier Institute in what was once the Weapon X facility. While confronting a SHIELD prison transport to free Emma Frost, Cyclops and Magneto begin to experience trouble controlling their mutant powers and inadvertently decimate the entire transport. The freed Emma is furious with Cyclops for everything that happened with the Phoenix, blaming him for Xavier's death and her imprisonment by the humans.Cyclops claims that the Phoenix was to blame, and begs Emma to read his mind to see how sorry he is. However, Emma can no longer access her psychic powers, revealing that being exposed to the Phoenix has altered their mutations. The Phoenix Five are all experiencing drastic changes in their mutant powers, as is Magneto due to being attacked with the Phoenix's power by Cyclops. Cyclops swears to Emma that he will find a way to fix them as they escape before the police arrive on scene. Together, they set out on a mission to rescue and recruit new mutants.A young Australian woman named Eva Bell awakens her mutant power to control space and time after her overprotective brother gets in a brawl, creating a block-wide time sphere that freezes everyone in it for over twenty hours. Cyclops, Emma, and Magneto arrive and offer to help her. The Australian police and federal guard are ready to take Eva into custody as the sphere goes down, but Cyclops and his team fight back to protect her. Cyclops and Magik then go to rescue a mutant named Christopher from police interrogation in Michigan.Despite resurrecting a dead friend with his mutant power, Christopher is being detained by anti-mutant police against his will. Freeing Christopher, Cyclops declares his team's goals of mutant freedom on a security camera. As they witness Cyclops' exploits on the news, Kitty Pryde, Storm, Iceman, and Beast become unnerved. They worry that Cyclops' "revolution" will bring unwanted attention to the Jean Grey School, and fear that a confrontation with him may spark a mutant civil war.An offhand comment made by Iceman gives Beast the idea to travel back in time, where he recruits the original five X-Men (Cyclops, Iceman, Angel, Beast, and Marvel Girl) in the hopes that they can show Cyclops the error of his ways.While dealing with his "broken" mutant power, Cyclops is confronted by Magneto. Erik tells that Scott that he must own up to what happened with the Phoenix, and that he cannot deflect for his hand in Xavier's death. He then states that if Cyclops truly wishes to redeem himself, he must find a way to fix their powers. Cyclops and Magneto later go to a pro-mutant rally to recruit a new mutant shapeshifter named Benjamin, only to be confronted by the time-displaced original X-Men.Staring down the his past self, Cyclops begins to question what he sees. He thinks maybe it is some telepath controlling his perception of what is real and what isn't, possibly Emma or even Professor Xavier. Cyclops comes to the realization that Emma would never do this to him, and that Xavier is truly dead.Upon noticing Jean his memories of her come flooding back. Jean's telepathy starts acting up as she hears all his thoughts, and in a moment of desperation she telekinetically blasts him away. This knocks Cyclops' visor off, and his out of control optic blasts destroy the immediate area. Young Cyclops attempts to stop him and the two trade blasts, with the former being quickly overwhelmed. The rest of the Original X-Men swarm in to attack as Magneto yells for Ilyana to teleport them away.As they return back to the Weapon X facility, Cyclops storms off to regain his composure. Emma seeks him out and he reluctantly discusses what happened. They come to the conclusion out only Hank McCoy would have the technology and knowledge bring the original X-Men to the present. Emma conjectures that since Beast can't kill Scott in retaliation for Xavier's death, he will instead punish him.Cyclops later returns to recruit Benjamin into his new school, as the latter has been expelled from college due to his mutation. Cyclops and his group return once again to the Jean Grey institute. Cyclops comes with an offer of new students to his side, and to explain himself for the events that transpired during his possession of the Phoenix Force, and his current course of intentions about training the students at the new Xavier institute. He defends himself to the school en masse that what happened was not his fault and that he would never deliberately murder Xavier.While the convincing doesn't go so well for him as too many of the older X-Men believe he should still turn himself in, he does state he will help protect the school and that he bears no ill will towards any of them and that he is actually disappointed in some of them. He leaves soon after his statements but returns shortly, giving the students some time to think.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">After a new mutant in San Diego named Fabio Medina has his power emerge as someone attempts to rob him. The police attempt to detain him, but Cyclops and his team arrive to protect their fellow mutant. They easily deal with the police as Eva, now under the alias of Tempus, and Magneto disarm them. A battalion of new sentinels shows up to hunt the revolutionaries, and partway into the brief scuffle Cyclops unleashes his newly altered optic blast.The devastating blast rips the parking lot and sentinels asunder, causing the immediate area to crater in and damage buildings. After the blast, Cyclops falls due to fatigue as the team head back to the Xavier Institute with their new recruit. Scott and Emma have a heart-to-heart conversation about their current situation and both decide to remain close but not together for the sake of the students. The two join in with the students and rest of the team to discuss what is going on in the mutant world including the sentinels attack and rebirth of the population, as well as go over the schematics of the new school.The team decides to go with Eva to visit her mother, so they teleport to Australia. Not long after arriving, the Avengers assemble on their location. Captain America attempts to arrest Cyclops, under the accusation of murdering Charles Xavier. Cyclops and Emma call out the Avengers for being equally as guilty as they are in they are for the events of the war, including Xavier's death. Cyclops declares the X-Men's goals, refusing to allow his people to be victimized any longer, and refuses to back down. The Avengers prepare to attack, and in the heat of the moment Tempus freezes them in a temporal bubble.Cyclops proclaims to the crowd of gathered people that the X-Men will protect all mutants from danger, along with the humans that support them. He warns, however, that those who would oppose mutant rights will be their enemy. When the X-Men teleport back to their school, they realize someone revealed their destination to the Avengers. Magneto admits it was him, revealing that he went to S.H.I.E.L.D. under the guise of being a traitor wanting to take down Cyclops. His intent was to root out the creators of the new sentinels. Cyclops shows disgust with the plan for the events that just transpired at first, but eventually realizes Magneto has a good idea.Cyclops tells the students to remain at the new institute while the main team departs. Magik then teleports the team to the Jean Grey School, where Cyclops intends to recruit new X-Men. Cyclops gives his explanation of his side of things and tells the X-Men that he would rather they kill him right then and there than continue to live with the thought that they think he would intentionally kill Xavier; the man who was a father to him. Cyclops also opens up a window of opportunity for students from the Jean Grey Institute to join his new Xavier Institute to prepare for their futures.He leaves to give them some time and upon returning to his school, he sees the new students have gotten stuck in the very realistic simulations of the Danger Room. In a random moment, Magik begins screaming in pain due to her powers finally showing her side-effects. She briefly disappears and returns in a burst of flames before running off. Scott leaves once again to the Jean Grey School and returns with the new students: the Stepford Cuckoos and the younger version of Angel.Magik once again begins writhing in pain and secludes herself from the team. Cyclops talks to her about what is happening with her. After the talk, Cyclops and Magik rejoin the team, but as soon as they do, Magik loses control once agains as the team is teleported into Limbo with Magik having transformed into Darkchilde. Dormammu has forcibly brought the X-Men into Limbo so he can kill Magik and the X-Men for being her friends in order to spite her. Cyclops commands the team to get back as he takes off his visor cowl and lets loose a massive optic blast that surprisingly hurts the extra-dimensional being, but it has little lasting effect and he collapses after. Dormammu summons his underlings to attack the X-Men, but the Stepford's telepathically turn the new students' fear into bravery and with Cyclops now back on his feet, the rest of the team begins fighting off Dormammu's minions.Cyclops and the team continues the charge. Cyclops manages to do the most damage as he lets his optic blasts loose, destroying many of the mindless ones. Illyana manages to save the group by casting them out of Limbo and then absorbs the entire dimension into her being. The team points out to Scott that he seems worse off than the rest in control and Scott apologizes to the students and team as they were not ready for what happened and that they must train. After the events of going to Limbo and fighting Dormammu, Fabio can't handle the pressure and Scott and Emma escort him home. Cyclops would later talk about Magneto about their current position with their powers and where they stand with each other, which only ended up with them coming to better standing of each other.Cyclops and the rest of the team are watching and coaching the new member of the team, David Bond, on his ability to control vehicles. This time being a massive plane. After receiving word of Fabio's kidnapping at the hands of S.H.I.E.L.D., Cyclops and his team invade the helicarrier where he is held in. They dispatch the S.H.I.E.L.D agents, save Fabio, and confront Dazzler about what happened. Cyclops tries to convince Dazzler to join but she declines and Cyclops coaxes David, now dubbed Hijack, to try and see the limit of his powers and to control the helicarrier.Cyclops and Emma are training the new students but the two have a bit of an argument. The two watch as Illyana and Eva train and are amazed when Eva does a new trick with her powers. The team watches on the news as pro-Cyclops supporters gather and start to address the issues they deem unfair for making Cyclops a wanted man. Cyclops and the team make their presence known and show up at the rally, where Cyclops tells the supporters to not blame the other good guys such as the Avengers and Fantastic Four. During his speech, the X-Men are attacked by a blockbuster sentinel.Cyclops appears to be vaporized by the sentinel's blast while demanding it to tell him who sent him. The team looks on in shock at his apparent death, but luckily Magik saves him just in time by teleporting him out of the way. He rallies the team to attack, and while trying his own optic blasts, he fires a weak shot. The more the X-Men attack it, the more the sentinel seems to adapt. In desperation and anger while trying to protect a woman, Cyclops does all he can to protect himself and the people around him, including his supporters. and unleashes a massive optic blast that does little damage to the adaptive sentinel. Eventually, Magneto arrives and does final attack that looks like it puts the sentinel out of commission. The sentinel looks ready to explode, but in his rage, Scott charges after it, demanding it tell him who sent it. Emma manages to save him before an explosion does occur, but only because the assailant pulled it back.Cyclops is seen pushing Benjamin quite hard in a training exercise, even going as far as attacking him and letting him get a free shot on Cyclops himself. After Emma helps Benjamin discover the exact nature of his abilities, Scott fully accepts him on the team. Scott sends the new mutants on a test to see how they handle being put in unpredictable situations. David breaks the rule of no cellphones, and this results in SHIELD tracking them. Cyclops kicks him off the team for his behavior.</hero:storyDescription>

When the situation turns dire for them, Cyclops and his team show up where Cyclops lays waste to a few of the attacking sentinels. After the quick rescue, the two X-Men factions join forces and defeat the remaining sentinels. One of the sentinel heads remains active and kills the younger Cyclops, and because of this, the older Cyclops ceases to exist. Thanks to Triage, the revival of the younger Scott Summers also returns the main one back to reality. After the battle, the groups part ways, and back at the Uncanny X-Men's base, the team is reviewing the footage of what happened, but Christopher runs off due to the traumatic experience that happened, and Scott goes to calm him down.The young Jean and Scott search out the Uncanny X-Men. Scott agrees to help them, but eventually a fight ensues with the future X-Men team. More teams continue to show up for the final battle. Amidst all of this, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s payload of anti-mutant weaponry is activated. Cyclops and the X-Men manage to stop it. Future Jean Grey eventually snaps and Cyclops and Wolverine try their best to hold her off, but the mutant is too strong but she ends up exploding. Scott and Wolverine continue to argue about the whole mess, but eventually part ways, albeit briefly, as Kitty Pryde leaves the Jean Grey Institute to join up with Cyclops' team.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When a new mutant is detected, Cyclops and his team check it out. It is a trap and the team is attacked by a large sentinel that spouts smaller sentinels. Cyclops runs point and tries to cause a distraction with an optic blast, but his powers begin to shut off, as well as the other members of his team. Magik saves the day with a spell and Cyclops comes to conclusion that SHIELD is indeed attacking them or someone else is using SHIELD. Either way the scenario, Cyclops declares war. Cyclops uses the Cuckoos to telepathically speak with Maria Hill to find out what she knows. He doesn't necessarily trust the information she has and says it may have been implanted. Scott and the rest of the team come to the conclusion that the person attacking them is using Cerebro to spread false alerts or track the team when a new mutant is activated. The only people that know would be Xavier, Magneto, or Beast. Scott and Magik take a trip to the Jean Grey Institute to confront Beast to talk with him about the sentinel attacks, hoping it isn't him, but all of a sudden Scott's powers act up and he unleashes a blast. Scott yells it isn't him attacking. Magik tries her luck but her powers also start acting up as she enters her demonic form. Storm manages to take them both out. SHIELD and the mysterious orchestrater of the events make their move. Beast in the meantime manages to figure out what is wrong with both Scott and Magik and who is the cause of all this.With the mysterious attacker using SHIELD tech and sentinels to assault the Jean Grey school, Cyclops and Magik are still indisposed until woken up by Beast. Hijack makes his surprise return and overpowers the hacker's control on the helicarriers and sentinels. When Cyclops is about to lead a defense, Beast takes him to where the assailant is. Beast reveals to Cyclops that the reason he couldn't control his powers was because he was with infected nanotech sentinels. Beast turns them off and Cyclops gains his control back. When they meet the assailant, Cyclops attacks him and it is revealed to be a sickly Dark Beast. Dark Beast says he attacked because he hates him, and with that he dies, but leaves a detonating helicarrier in his wake. Cyclops calls in Hijack and Magik, and Hijack stops the detonation. Cyclops and Beast leave and talk with Maria Hill about what has happened and that it happened on her watch with her tech and equipment. With that Cyclops takes his team and leaves.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Cyclops reminisces of the events where he killed Xavier. He attempts to talk with Eva about how she got stuck in a time bubble, but she tells him off and leaves. Cyclops also goes and apologizes to Hijack, and the two reconcile with Hijack being allowed back on the team. Cyclops is then next seen with the JGS staff in his base, telling him they need to leave and go to Xavier's will reading. The main NXS staff leave and go to the Jean Grey Institute. She-Hulk is in charge of the will reading and they learn Xavier is married to Mystique and now they must perform his task of what he called his darkest secret. Cyclops and the rest of the X-Men listen to Xavier's message about how years ago, he discovered a young mutant of frightening power by the name of Matthew Malloy.When Xavier went to visit the boy, he lashed out with a type of dimensional energy and the child would somehow block most of Xavier's telepathy. Xavier would slowly push and manipulate his way into the child's mind so that he could help control him, for if Magneto were to get him, his use as a weapon could be catastrophic, and if he were to fail being taken in by Xavier, then he would destroy any chances at peace mutants had. Xavier would explain that once inside his mind, he placed several blocks, made the boy forget what happened, what happened to his parents, and suppressed his mutant abilities, and virtually lobotomized him. Xavier knew this would go against everything he taught the X-Men that no mutant shall be left behind. Scott would resort to calling Xavier a hypocrite. Out of anger and shock by Scott's outburst, Iceman would tell Scott to just kill Xavier again, resulting in Bobby getting blasted. The brief fight was broken up and the majority of the message was played. Xavier's last mission for them would be for Scott and Wolverine to get together a team to find Michael, and have the strongest telepath they have to reinforce the mental blocks Xavier placed on him.Cyclops would storm out of the Jean Grey Institute in a fit of anger, denying doing Xavier's final request and talking about how Xavier lied to them all while teaching them something different. The X-Men try and convince him, but only Emma seems to get through, telling him Xavier would do it for Scott. Cyclops reluctantly goes on the mission. During the mission, the X-Men join up with SHIELD and they all try to discuss what to do with Matthew. Rachel Grey tries to perform a similar approach with Xavier, but upon Matthew discovering they aren't Xavier, he destroys the helicarrier they are on. Cyclops and the rest of the group get sent into different directions, with him landing at the New Xavier Institute. He has a brief anxiety attack and would recover shortly after with a new plan. Scott would have Magik teleport him to Matthew where Scott simply asks him to talk.Scott has Magik teleport him and Matthew a top of a mountain away from a population. Cyclops begins to tell Matthew about what Xavier did for Scott, but that he may not right after all. Cyclops tells him that no matter what the X-Men have done, people have still hated them for just existing. Scott tells Matthew he will help him repay his debt for killing the innocent lives on accident, but he will also help him with his powers and that they must rise up and take their place in this world. Matthew loses control again and Magik teleports Scott away, but Scott asks her to put him back. Magik tells him he is reminding her of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, but Scott says he must save him. He goes back to talk with Matthew when he is calm but Magneto shows up and tells Scott he has gone too far.Magneto argues with Scott about what he is doing with Malloy. Cyclops reveals some of what Magneto has done in the past, and Malloy ends up teleporting Magneto away. Matthew feels he doesn't belong on this world and Cyclops tries to reason with him. Malloy ends up telling Scott he doesn't know if Malloy is good for this world. Magik comes with the Eye of Agamotto to reveal to Malloy if he is going to help or be what they fear. But before they can do that, SHIELD helicarriers come and blow them all up.Scott is brought back to life when Eva goes back in time with Xavier and they prevent Matthew's parents from ever becoming a couple. The Will is read and Xavier leaves his inheritance to Scott. Scott leaves for a moment and Eva talks with him about what actually happened and she blames him for everything that happened on that day before she fixed it. Scott kicks her out of the school and Eva leaves. Scott comes back in and signs everything over to Storm, and he also asks her to take in his students.Cyclops pushes away his team except for Alex who stays. At the end, Cyclops goes to Washington D.C. where he holds a rally with every single mutant on the planet on the steps of congress saying that this is the mutant revolution; all mutants are united and no one is hurting each other.</hero:storyDescription>

However, the teen Cyclops has gone off the grid, and tries to bring down a group of extremists known as the Ghosts of Cyclops on his own. After a brief public clash, Scott tracks the Ghost to a college outside of the city, where he is attacked and ultimately arrested by the police. The use of his powers allows his former teammates to track him down. After this incident, the teen Scott has an epiphany, and decides to rejoin his friends so that he can redeem the name "Cyclops" and make up for the actions of his adult counterpart.During the Inhumans vs. X-Men storyline, Cyclops takes part in the mutant assault on New Attilan after it is discovered that the Terrigen cloud will soon dissipate into the atmosphere, rendering the entire planet lethal to mutant life. During the fight, he briefly faces off against the young Inhuman hero Inferno before being attacked by Medusa. He is rescued from the Inhuman queen by Magneto, and is with the other X-Men who return to Muir Island. However, after being possessed by Mosaic, Scott learns that his adult counterpart had already died before the confrontation with Black Bolt, and that it was actually Emma Frost using his image who was to blame.

Some time later, Cyclops blasts out of his grave and meets up with Kid Cable and explains what happened and that Scott is needed and didn't deserve the death he received. Cyclops dons his old Astonishing outfit, and the two head to Paul Douek's house where Tavin is attacking him in an act of revenge and once again save him. As a result, Cyclops also now has all of the memories of his teenage counterpart as well.Cable and Scott head to a beach and Cyclops explains he was wrong for his actions over the last few years and that he set his species over everyone, becoming the very thing he swore to fight against. He and Cable now set out on a mission to rebuild the X-Men after Nate Grey's attack against the original team to set things right.</hero:storyDescription>

Five months pass and mutantkind lives on the sovereign nation of Krakoa where they establish their own language and finally a home. Cyclops steps out of a portal after Sabretooth is captured by the Fantastic Four. Cyclops states he will take Victor, but the Fantastic Four decline. Cyclops humors them and says he will get him another time then, but before leaving, tells them Krakoa has a place for their son Franklin.Xavier assigns Scott the task of forming a team to go and stop a group of rogue scientists called Orchis from creating a new Master Mold called a Mother Mold. Scott and his team fly to the space station orbiting the Sun, but upon landing, their ship is destroyed by a bomb going off.After recovering Angel's corpse who died during the explosion alongside Husk, Cyclops is able to assure the intelligence team back on Krakoa that the his team would still be able to complete the mission via Jean's telepathy. He then assigns himself and the majority of his team to individually disengage the Mother Mold's control collars that keep it from falling into the Sun while Jean and M stay behind to maintain contact with Earth. After realizing that Mystique had failed her own assignment, Scott is forced to allow and order Wolverine and Nightcrawler to sacrifice themselves in order to destroy the final control collar. After regaining telepathic contact with Jean, Scott reassures her that he would still be able to meet her and help each other escape the station before he is shot down and incapacitated by Omega Sentinel. Scott is able to apologize for failing to keep his promise to Jean before he is executed by the grief stricken Doctor Alia Gregor.Cyclops and the rest of the deceased team of mutants are resurrected by a group of called the Five. The process involves Goldballs producing a gold ball, which turns out they were eggs. Proteus turns the eggs viable. The eggs are injected with the preserved DNA of the mutant and Elixir then kickstarts the cellular growth process. Tempus matures the body and Hope ensures it all happens. Upon the hatching, Xavier uses Cerebro to implant Scott and the rest of the teamï¿½s essences and memories into their new bodies, thus successfully resurrecting them.Cyclops and his team take out an ORCHIS base. He heads back to his new home, a Krakoa biosphere inhabited by the Summers-Grey families and Wolverine. Corsair comes to visit and the family come to visit for dinner, where Scott gives him a seed to act as a portal to come visit whenever he wants. Scott takes Rachel and Cable on a mission to a mysterious island that Krakoa is heading towards to uncover why. They encounter and accidentally start fighting a mysterious being capable of summoning various creatures, but soon halt the fight when Krakoa and the mystery island merge together.The Savage Land gateway of Krakoa becomes unresponsive, resulting in Krakoa itself feeling pain. Scott is sent out with Emma and Sebastian Shaw to discover the cause. The section is invaded by Hordeculture, a group elderly, radical botanists with the intent of restoring the planet to it was committing mass genoicide of the human race. Due to the expansion of Krakoa, their plans have been foiled. With their anti-mutant equipment and preying on Scott's morals, they manage to take advantage of him and Shaw, before they leave when Emma confronts them.Cyclops attends a World Economic Forum as security to Xavier, Magneto and Apocalypse where he is sent with Gorgon to dispatch a strike team posed to circle in on the mutant leaders during the discussions.During a raid on Orchis to free mutant children, the X-Men accidentally free Serafina, a member of the Children of the Vault. Upon initial failure of capturing her before she returned to the Vault, Cyclops leads a team to get a smaller squad consisting of Darwin, Synch, and X-23 to get in the vault themselves. After successfully achieving their mission with getting into the Vault and as time passes, Cyclops questions his decision on the mission.The day of Crucible is upon the isle of Krakoa, where a mutant turned human due to the Scarlet Witch will die to be reborn. Scott seeks guidance on the matter and ventures to find Nightcrawler for words of wisdom, as they watch the event go down with Melody Guthrie being struck down by Apoclypse and reborn as a mutant once more.The New Mutants team returns to Earth but they bring a King Egg, which the Brood hunt down and invade Krakoa. Cyclops leads the charge with Magik as they fend off the first wave of Brood with some of the other mutants. Cyclops is told to get the egg off world and he tells Havok and Gabriel to fire up the jet where they head to a Shiï¿½ar space gate. Cyclops and his crew team up with some of Shiï¿½ar as the Brood still chase them. They crash land on a nearby planet and are attempting to fight off the swarm coming after the king egg, only for the swarm to stop. Broo broke the egg and drinks some of the contents, now becoming leader of the Brood, adding their ranks now to the mutant nation.After the events of X of Swords, Scott stares off at the Arakko Point with his kids as they watch the island of Arakko emerge from the external gate. While talking Xavier and Magneto, he and Jean decline two open seats on the Quiet Council. Scott and her state they feel they need to represent the X-Men in a way that doesnï¿½t have them being told what to do and how to think, but he is still a captain to Krakoa and will come if needed. Scott decides to put up an election and vote who will be on his and Jeanï¿½s team.Cyclops, Jean and Storm receive a distress call from Deathbird of the Shiï¿½ar Empire, explaining Xandra has been kidnapped.

He shows Scott and Jean the image and Scott knows what it is. He takes them to the orbital space station, S.W.O.R.D., where Cable reignites the core, turning the abandoned station back on. Cyclops and Jean confront the Quiet Council about contacting Cable and Scottï¿½s plan. He decides to go to Arakko, save everyone, and close the gates after. He then leaves with Jean with Emma telling the Cuckoos to meet up with him. Scott communicates with Illyana via telepathy from Jean and the sisters, asking her to open the gate. When she does, the entire S.W.O.R.D station descends where the rest of the mutants deploy from it to fight. Scott joins the fray. They grab Cable and teleport to the station once again to charge up an energy blast.

In his moment of fear, he tries to escape but Cyclops, Forge and Firestar come to rescue him. They are attacked by a Sentinel Zero that is using an old Wolverine skeleton as its chassis. Cyclops blasts it and Firestar uses a massive flame attack to incinerate the rest of the foe, leaving only the skeleton to remain, as the team has saved the mutant and the day. Cyclops is called into Forgeï¿½s lab where Forge asks him how many times has Wolverine died and they havenï¿½t recovered his skeleton.Feilong of Orchis overtook Stark Unlimited and using Iron Manï¿½s patents, they built a new Stark Sentinel and programmed it with mutant hunting capabilities. Upon discovering and attacking a mutant in New York, Cyclops and the team leapt into action.

  <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://whosyourhero.com/heroes.owl#Power"/>
  <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Cyclops possesses the mutant ability to project powerful beams of a heatless, concussive force from his eyes, which act as extra-dimensional apertures to a non-Einsteinian universe where the endless concussive force resides. Cyclops constantly absorbs ambient sunlight into his body's cells, metabolizing the energy in order to open the apertures.Cyclops' mind generates a psionic field that is attuned to the same forces that maintain the apertures. This field envelops his body, protecting him from his own power. Even the thin membranes of Cyclops' eyelids are sufficient to block the emission of energy, allowing him to contain power by simply closing his eyes. The synthetic ruby quartz crystals used in the lenses of Cyclops' sunglasses and visor are resonant to his minds' psionic field, making them the only substance that can effectively block his blasts.The width of Cyclops' optic blast is controlled by his mind's psionic field. As Cyclops focuses the apertures in his eyes are altered to control the flow of energy and the power of the beam, which is filtered through his visor.The maximum force of Cyclops' blasts is unknown, but a commonly given description is that they can "punch holes through mountains", and he has been shown rupturing steel plates and pulverizing solid rock. It has been stated that Cyclops uses only a fraction of his vast potential energy output. His more powerful optic blasts can demolish fully-armored tanks, severely damage Sentinels, and obliterate entire icebergs.Though the extra-dimensional energy supply of Cyclops' blasts is practically infinite, his own stamina is not. He can exhaust himself by projecting too much energy for a continuous rate, resulting in his blasts weakening in power. So long as Cyclops's psionic field is active (which is constant) there is the potential to emit energy, with the only limit being the mental fatigue of focusing for an extended period.Due to psychological trauma and a head injury, Cyclops is unable to shut off his optic blasts and must therefore wear ruby quartz lenses at all times to block the beams. Emma Frost revealed that the trauma of losing his family, and anxiety of hurting someone with his power, are primarily responsible for his lack of control. Mr. Sinister has claimed that Cyclops' eyes have become reliant on ruby quartz, making it harder for him to control the blasts on his own. After overcoming his past trauma, with some "help" from Emma, Cyclops gained control of his power for a period of time. He gradually began losing control however, and had to revert back to using his special eyewear.</hero:powerDescription>

  <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> While in possession of a fraction of the Phoenix Force as a member of the Phoenix Five, Cyclops gained a myriad of powerful cosmic abilities. He possessed complete control over his optic blasts, interstellar flight, vast psionic powers including telepathy and telekinesis, and manipulation of the destructive and creative cosmic energy of the Phoenix. Also, even with only 1/5 of the Phoenix Force, he possessed tremendous superhuman durability, enough to easily withstand punches and tackles from Gladiator.Cyclops' optic blasts were greatly increased in power, as he was able to effortlessly match Gladiator's heat vision, as well as able to easily hurt Thor. His immense telekinetic power was sufficient to stop Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, in mid-swing with relative ease, as well as effortlessly shatter Iron Man's armor. While in possession of half the Phoenix's vast power, Cyclops was capable of simultaneously defeating multiple Avengers with a single optic blast. When he had the full power of the Phoenix Force, he was causing disasters all over the planet, and managed to punch Hulk from Australia to the United States. However, as he gained more power, Cyclops became more vulnerable to the Phoenix's corrupting influence over his thoughts and emotions.Before the final incursion, Cyclops found a Phoenix Egg before hand and raised it until it was ready to hatch. Then in the final battle of the final incursion, Cyclops once again bonds with the new Phoenix Force, but this time he has much better control with no signs of its corrupting influence.Broken Optic BlastsCyclops' mutation was altered after his prolonged exposure to the Phoenix Force, resulting in a much greater power output. His blast strength was increased to the point that Cyclops was able to briefly hurt Dormammu. Despite this upgrade in power, it does come at a price. Cyclops has lost further control of his optic blasts, causing him to overexert himself rapidly. Another side effect of blasts being altered is that he has many smaller blasts that branch off of the main blast. Instead of one focused beam, it is one large beam with a bunch of smaller ones that spiral off at the sides from the main beam, thus making his blasts much harder to dodge. Overtime and more use, Cyclops' blasts returned to their normal depiction and power.</hero:powerDescription>

According to Nick Fury, Cyclops' leadership skills are at their best in tense situations. Fury notes that the less time Cyclops has to think about a decision, the better it tends to be. Professor X entrusted Cyclops with the tremendous responsibility of leading the X-Men, sensing that he possessed a strong combination of analytical intelligence and tactical brilliance.After years of intensive training in the Danger Room and leading teams of X-Men into combat, Cyclops has evolved into an eminent strategist and battle tactician.</hero:powerDescription>

He is a superb athlete and martial artist with extensive training in hand-to-hand combat, holding black belts in judo and aikido. His combat prowess is sufficient enough to easily take down a gang of thugs with his eyes closed, disarm and beat down a gunman before he could get a shot off when Cyclops' back was turned, and effortlessly defeat a trio of brutish convicts.</hero:powerDescription>

  <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Thanks to training from Professor Xavier, and due in part to his own emotional stoicism, Cyclops has developed a degree of resistance to psychic probing and manipulation. He is virtually immune to casual scans, and possesses an awareness that makes him difficult to read even for high-level telepaths. Cyclops has honed his mind to such a point that he can maintain his psychic defenses subconscious. He has done so to the point that his defenses even while he sleeps aren't easy to get through, as admitted by a telepath like Emma Frost. He was capable of trapping a sliver of the Void, a dark and powerful entity, in a psychic prison within his mind.</hero:powerDescription>

Some people might argue his treatment was worse than Jack's thanks to all of the messing around in Scott's brain, and that when Scott killed him Avengers vs. X-Men, he had it coming.</hero:tropeDescription>

Then when he seems to have found happiness with with Emma, Cassandra Nova manipulates her mind so she turns on the team. Scott knows this is not the real Emma and eventually she is freed from Nova's control.

His recent treatment of the remaining mutants (especially minors) drifts into this trope as well. Recent X-Men author Kieron Gillen even cited this characteristic as his central motivation for the character. His entire mentality is that of a soldier. He was raised to be a soldier, looks at life from a soldier's perspective, and acts like a military man at all times. In First Class, he even admits that had it not been for his power being uncontrollable, he would have likely enlisted once he was old enough. Its notable that his father was an air force pilot, and in the Film Universe, Alex was in a military prison when Xavier found him. It runs in the family.</hero:tropeDescription>

Cyclops responded by optic blasting Captain America off Utopia, and prompting him to call in the rest of the Avengers to start fighting. The entire mess would've been avoided if the two leaders of the superhero and mutant communities had actually talked things over like adults. Though admittedly, Scott did kind of have reason to be suspicious of Cap, since a) he was gambling everything on Hope being able to control the Phoenix and restart Mutantkind, b) Cap was getting his information on the Phoenix from Wolverine, who even the other Avengers (notably Spider-Man, who pointedly followed Wolverine for that exact reason) suspected was going to try and kill Hope before she could become the Phoenix - which is exactly what he tried to do as soon as he got the chance, c) Cap invaded Utopia, a sovereign nation with a SHIELD battalion that has no jurisdiction there and the Avengers and immediately responds with authority (which he does not have) for Scott to surrender Hope into his custody or suffer the consequences.

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Scott must always wear a special visor or pair of glasses to contain his optic blasts. When these devices are removed, he keeps his eyes shut, rendering him blind. Due to an important instance of this, he has since learned how to fight blind by using his hearing to pinpoint opponents and simply always scrutinizing his surroundings to know the lay of the land. One side story shows that he also counts his steps and memorizes which way he turns so that he can retrace his path and find his eyewear. Even with the visor/glasses, he's still colorblind, only able to see in shades of red. It's possible he shouldn't be able to pilot an aircraft such as the Blackbird, but there are custom control panels that have indicators based on number of lights, rather than color. Presumably, the Blackbird has one of them. Bonus points for the reason he can't control his optic blasts - at a young age he was in an accident and suffered severe head trauma, but fortunately there wasn't any damage to any "important" parts of the brain. This was before he developed the ability to obliterate everything in sight... Sadly, this actually plausible explanation (a rare sight in comic books) has been re-explained or outright removed several times, with many writers defaulting to "he just can't control it because that's how it is."</hero:tropeDescription>

Jubilee and Wolverine have both been turned, and the latter is standing only a few feet away, ready to cut his head off and turn the rest of the X-Men. Cyke's response? Pulling out a control to reactivate Wolverine's Healing Factor, turning him back. That's right, Scott discovered he was immune to vampirism and that the vampires wanted to turn him, so he deactivated his Healing Factor and allowed him to be turned, just so he could turn him back right when they were relying on him to lead their forces. The vampires, still in shock, are promptly slaughtered. Meanwhile, Scott's earlier plan, to bring back Dracula and have him take back the vampire horde, appeared to have failed and was forgotten...only for it to turnout Dracula had been tracking down Xarus all this time, and after curbstomping his son and taking back his place, Cyke warns him that he could kill him with the push of a button. Dracula claims that he knows he's bluffing, but still lets them leave in peace.

He spends an issue or two in a completely catatonic state, his powers not functioning. He soon recovers enough to move around and lead the team (perhaps even more effectively than usual, with his self-control issues out of the way) and later surprises everyone by revealing (with a point blank blast in the face of his interrogator) that his powers still work, and that he now has full control over them. At the end of the arc, this control fades as the "clarity" he got from Emma's intervention wears off. See Status Quo Is God. He seems to be prone to hitting these when he fails to stop people being hurt. Even prior to joining the X-Men. When he was 12 years old he hit one because he couldn't stop another orphan jumping off of the roof of the orphanage. Seriously.</hero:tropeDescription>

He's not a bad guy by any means, and all he's concerned with now is protecting the new mutants from those who wish to harm them. He's yet to kill anyone doing so, and wants nothing more but to bury the hatchet with his former team and allies so they can work together to honor Xavier's memory. However, the fact that 'those who wish to harm them' often includes trigger-happy police officers who he's forced to fight to deal with them, along with many of his former team having personal grievances that clouds their judgement (and soils other people's perceptions of him when they tell others about it), he's became SHIELD's number one priority. Subverted though, as the public in general are actually rather supportive of him and see him as a freedom fighter opposing a corrupt institution, while its the superhero community who hate him. After Secret Wars (2015), he became this posthumously. Details were sparse other than "he went crazy and died doing something terrible" until Death of X. There, it was revealed that the bad publicity wasn't even his fault at all. He was one of the first mutants to die from M-Pox, and everything that "he" did afterward was a psychic projection created by a grief-stricken Emma Frost. His younger self tries to rectify this, all the while believing that sassing Blackbolt is a completely legit cause of death.</hero:tropeDescription>

The warlord attacks him, demanding to know what else he's been lying about. Cue the eye beams. Another instance of this is in the first volume of Ultimate X-Men. Cyclops is being restrained by a Sentinel because it has figured out that he operates his optic blasts by pressing a button on the side of his visor.

(In fact, he is firing them 24/7, they're just being blocked.) This limitation was said to be a mental block, and was fixed by Emma Frost for a short while. After that he either decides that he is better off with the mental block, or whatever she did with his brain wore off. Used to be from having hit his head in the accident that killed his parents. There was a throwaway scene in one of the comics shortly after Wolverine lost his Adamantium (and briefly regressed to a neanderthallic state) where Cyclops hit his head in some kind of rune-covered pit, and a caption stated, "A subtle change is worked in an area of his brain damaged so long ago", so it's possible both explanations are correct. After the events of AvX, the visor can't block his eyebeams anymore. The only thing that can are his own eyelids.</hero:tropeDescription>

Following Xavier stepping down, he basically becomes this to the entire Mutant race.

Later Wolverine calls him out on his willingness to allow children to fight on the front lines (though in his defense, that's not that much different then how the X-Men have been since they were first formed. Logan's comments were also made with X-23 in mind, who he was trying to help find a normal life of not being a Living Weapon). This is pretty much how Scott reacts when ever somebody tells him he's acting like Magneto. Taken to extreme lengths with everyone's reaction to finding out Scott assembled the X-Force, a black ops team with the most dangerous mutants to go and kill the X-Men's most deadly enemies who could possibly eradicate the last of the mutants. What they (and sadly some fans) fail to notice is that that is exactly what has prevented every last mutant on earth from being eradicated. Note that the second that Bastion and the Purifiers are defeated, Scott disbands the team since they won't be up against anyone as dangerous as them in the meantime.

  <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Cyclops has a much smaller role in the third movie, X-Men: The Last Stand, and is shown disheveled and depressed in the years following Jean's death. While out riding his motorcycle, Cyclops is confronted by Jean, who has now been reborn as the Phoenix. Cyclops passionately embraces Jean and expresses joy at her return, only to be quickly and unceremoniously killed off-screen, with Wolverine only finding his glasses at the scene of the murder.Cyclops' fate was highly controversial among the fans, with the filmmakers later admitting that his death was the result of James Marsden leaving the franchise for the ill-fated Superman Returns movie.</hero:mediaDescription>

  <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">James Marsden makes a surprise cameo in the finale of X-Men: Days of Future Past, reprising his role from so many years ago. In the movie, Wolverine successfully changes history after traveling back in time to 1973 and convincing a young Charles Xavier to stop Mystique from killing Bolivar Trask. As a result of Mystique sparing Trask and never becoming an outright supervillain, the timeline is altered so that the events of The Last Stand never occurred. In the new present, Wolverine finds both Scott and Jean alive and as teachers in the Xavier Institute, with Scott once again acting standoffish after seeing Wolverine attempting to embrace Jean. Despite his behavior, Wolverine expresses joy at seeing Scott again after so many years.In interviews, writer Simon Kinberg and producer Lauren Shuler Donner claimed that Days of Future Past was meant as an apology to those who were upset by the deaths of Cyclops and Jean, as well as the generally poor quality of X-Men: The Last Stand.</hero:mediaDescription>

  <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Cyclops is an experienced member of the X-Men, and had a long-term relationship with Jean Grey. Both Jean and Professor X went missing after a mysterious attack on the mansion. With the mansion razed to the ground and the X-Men disbanded, Scott struggled to find Jean on his own. After an unsuccessful year of searching, he ended up living in a run-down apartment. He didn't shave, and sat around watching the TV news all day, desperate for any sign of Jean's whereabouts. This was where Wolverine found him. The two had fought over something in the past, which Jean had insisted that he apologize to Logan for.After a year Cyclops appeared to be just as aggressive towards Wolverine. So much so that when Logan approached him to rejoin the X-Men, Cyclops blasted him through a wall and out into the street. Cyclops finally relented and joined after he heard the news that Emma Frost had used Cerebro to locate the Professor. Cyclops remained hopeful that she would also be able to locate Jean in a similar way, but she claimed that she was unable to.However, Cyclops joined the team and aided in the raid on Magneto's Genosha to retrieve the Professor. Once the Professor's body had been returned to the mansion, he appeared as a telepathic projection in front of the X-Men. The Professor was telepathically contacting them from 20 years in the future, and asked that the X-Men endeavor to prevent the Days of Future Past-style future from occurring. Cyclops was visibly shocked when the Professor asked Wolverine to lead the X-Men instead of him.Since then his obsession to find Jean Grey drove Cyclops to confront the X-Men's old enemies, the Marauders. He attacked, defeated, and kidnapped Harpoon out on the street. The other X-Men didn't share his belief that Harpoon could lead him to Sinister, and therefore to Jean. However, Emma Frost confirmed that she telepathically probed Harpoon's mind, thus revealing the whereabouts of all the other Marauders. Consequently, Cyclops went on a rampage, openly using his mutant powers in public and violently destroying Sinister's laboratory. He was overwhelmed by the many duplicates of Jamie Madrox, but was eventually saved by the other X-Men.He is later more relaxed, to the point that he did not change into his X-Men uniform when Rogue told him about the Brotherhood's attack. He was still in his civilian clothes when the attack begun, and had his ruby quartz glasses knocked off. Toad spat adhesive slime to make the glasses stick to the ceiling, and began to goad Cyclops over his lack of control. However, he then opened his eyes to unleash the full force of his powers straight through the mansion. He disabled various members of the Brotherhood this way, but then covered up his eyes with his arms until Logan returned his ruby quart glasses. Cyclops remains obsessively loyal and desperate to find Jean Grey. So much so that he appears oblivious to Emma Frost, who continues to look at him longingly from afar.The cards are switched when Emma finally finds Jean, and they attempt to run off back to the mansion. However, Emma betrays the team when they get there, and takes off with Jean. She is revealed to be the White Queen of the Hellfire Club. Emma tries desperately to explain to Jean that the Phoenix will destroy her if she does not allow the Hellfire Club to help her. She later betrays Jean too when she sneaks into her mind and attempts to break the walls created by Xavier, to allow the Phoenix Form to enter. The walls are broken, and Jean wakes up. Scott then appears, and they have a three way showdown.Cyclops in turn betrays Emma for Jean, expressing what a horrid woman she is before leaving with Jean. Later on, Jean witnesses that the only way to get rid of the Phoenix is to allow it to reside in her. Scott stops the Phoenix by shooting it with his optic blasts. However, it comes back to take over Jean, and he once again tries to keep it away. At the nick of time Emma appears and jumps in front of the Phoenix who was en-route to killing Scott and possessing Jean. In the end Emma asks Scott to forgive her before she bursts into thousands of diamond shards, releasing the Phoenix. Scott and Jean are then reunited as the series ends.Nolan North provided the voice of Cyclops.</hero:mediaDescription>
