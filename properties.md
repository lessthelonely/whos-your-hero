Equivalent stuff
- Other media <-> Video Games <-> Television -> so only one that doesn't have this is midnighter
- Characteristics <-> Personal Characteristics <-> Character Profile <-> Personal Information -> so only one that doesn't have this is midnighter
- Alternate Versions <-> Alternate Realities <-> Other Version <-> Variants -> again only midnighter doesn't have this

I would say eliminate Creators thoughts on, current events, popular recognition, origin_post-flaspoint, disambiguation, merchandise, weapons and equipment 

Character Evolution doesn't exist for wally and cassandra
