Equivalent stuff
- Other media <-> Video Games <-> Television <-> Merchandise -> so only one that doesn't have this is midnighter DONE
- Characteristics <-> Personal Characteristics <-> Character Profile <-> Personal Information -> so only one that doesn't have this is midnighter DONE
- Alternate Versions <-> Alternate Realities <-> Other Version <-> Variants -> again only midnighter doesn't have this DONE

I would say eliminate Creators thoughts on, current events, popular recognition, origin_post-flaspoint, disambiguation, weapons and equipment 

Midnighter doesn't have other media or characteristics
Wally doesn't have Character Evolution or Creation
Cassandra doesn't have Character Evolution
Wally and Cassandra have appearances which is very interesting but the others don't :(

Ask if it's worth for characteristics
