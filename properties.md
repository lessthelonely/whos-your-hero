# Uncommon Properties
- Alternate Versions (wally)
- Alternate Realities (emma)
- Other Version (cass)
- Variants (deadpool)


Equivalent stuff
- Other media <-> Video Games <-> Television <-> Merchandise -> so only one that doesn't have this is midnighter DONE
- Characteristics <-> Personal Characteristics <-> Character Profile <-> Personal Information -> so only one that doesn't have this is midnighter DONE
- Alternate Versions <-> Alternate Realities <-> Other Version <-> Variants -> again only midnighter doesn't have this

I would say eliminate Creators thoughts on, current events, popular recognition, origin_post-flaspoint, disambiguation, weapons and equipment 

Character Evolution doesn't exist for wally and cassandra

Do subtitles for alternate versions
Ask if it's worth for characteristics
