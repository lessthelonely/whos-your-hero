  <hero:evolution rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Deadpool's debut marked a very different version of the character. He was a serious, grim, and professional assassin, with none of his personality trademarks intact. It would be in his solo book that his trademark character traits would finally emerge. These would include the dark randomness to his actions, his humorous bend, schizophrenic tendencies, his suicidal personal outlook, and his 4th wall breaking quips that would make him famous, along with his love for Mexican food. Recently, Deadpool has been trying to be a hero.Deadpool has been known for carrying a number of weapons and sometimes it is as if they appear from nowhere, this is often referred to as a 'magic satchel'. Blind Al is also a significant catalyst in Deadpool's personal development, as there is a clear love hate relationship which can vary from Blind Al being a mother-like figure to an abused hostage; sometimes within the same storyline.Starting with Daniel Way's run, to depict Deadpool's unstable sanity, creators started featuring POV shots of how cartoonish Deadpool saw the world and multiple narrative voices. He had at least three voices: Deadpool's insane inner monologue, a saner narrative voice of reason, and his own out loud voice. All three would argue with each other. Eventually, the extra narrative box would be ret-conned as rival Madcap through a flashback where both were destroyed, and Wade absorbed him during his healing process.As Deadpool's popularity increased, so did his prominence in the publishing line. In a meta twist, his popularity was included in-universe with Wade monetizing his own heroism. After earning the trust of both Wolverine and Captain America, he was recruited to X-men and Avengers adjacent teams. He started a friendship with Spider-Man and was often featured as a guest star across multiple books. After ruining his in-universe reputation during the Secret Empire event, Deadpool's appearances dropped drastically. Ever since, his on-goings have failed to catch on, but he has found a regular main character role in the Krakoa version of X-Force.</hero:evolution>
  <hero:creation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Created by artist Rob Liefeld and writer Fabian Nicieza, Deadpool made his first appearance in The New Mutants #98 (1991). Rob Liefeld has publicly stated that he had always loved the simplicity of Spider-Man's design, and therefore designed a character with a full-head mask. Deadpool was originally a parody of DC Comics' character Deathstroke, and there are real name similarities (Deathstroke’s real name is Slade Wilson) between the two. Wade's alias "Deadpool" was taken from the fifth Dirty Harry film The Dead Pool.Another inspiration was G.I. Joe's ninja Snake-Eyes.</hero:creation>

  <hero:origin rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Wade Wilson was born as a normal person into a highly dysfunctional family in a small town in the state of Ohio. He ran away as a teenager and bounced around the country, all the while getting military training from various sources until he decided to become a mercenary. He kept changing his identity whenever something went wrong with the mission. He moved to Canada where he met a man by the name of Wade T. Wilson. Since he was Wade W. Wilson, the name reminded him of his old self. When he was ordered to assassinate Wade T., he accidentally killed the target's wife, Mercedes. In the end, Wade T. ran away to eventually become the voodoo mercenary T-Ray while Wade W. kept the name "Wade T. Wilson" and never changed it out of respect for his namesake's wife. When he was diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer, he volunteered for a subset of the Weapon-X program that was attempting to imbue a normal human with Wolverine’s healing factor.Since he is Wade T. Wilson, he has Canadian citizenship, allowing him entry into the Weapon X program. The procedure was a success, but Deadpool, who took his name from the pool that the officers and scientists bet in as to who would die next in the experimentation, became severely mentally unbalanced as a result of it. He escaped the facility and has been wandering ever since. Some people might speculate that before his name was Wade Winston Wilson his name was Jack though this isn't confirmed.</hero:origin>

He said that around 2034, he was hired to stop some very determined rebels, but when the threat of hand-held nuclear devices became apparent, he hid himself in an industrial freezer and was going to work for whichever side wasn't blown up... however destroyed buildings trapped Deadpool, blocking the freezer door with debris. He then spent the next several decades in this tomb going even more insane, until he was finally released by a band of gun-toting nomads, but he was then attacked by Stryfe. It turned out that after everyone blew themselves up, Stryfe came in and made himself the ruler of the world, so Deadpool decided to work for him. While fighting with Styfe, Deadpool is torn in half and is apparently killed (but he always finds a way to come back).</hero:alternateVersionsDescription>

The Watcher claims that Psycho Man's plan succeeds in other universes and he uses an army of brain-washed heroes and villains to take over the world. But, something even worse happens in this particular universe. Psycho Man fails to overtake DP. And, although Psycho Man is murdered by DP (along with the rest of the employees and patients of the psychiatric institute), his attempt at mind control unlocks a new inner-voice. This voice continues to insist that DP kill the entirety of the Marvel Universe, to spare them from the misery they're put through for the entertainment of readers. Deadpool succeeds, continuously, breaking the fourth wall saying that this is what the readers wanted. Some of the notable scenes of the book are when Wade kills the Fantastic Four, Hulk, the Punisher, Taskmaster, Wolverine and the Watcher himself.At the end of the series, Man-Thing sacrifices himself as a portal to the comic book writer's dimension where he intends to follow through in killing not only his own Marvel Universe, but all of the Universes in existence. The last panel concludes with Wade standing near the bickering creators of Deadpool Kills The Marvel Universe, breaking the fourth wall with a threat (or is it a promise?) to find the reader "soon enough."</hero:alternateVersionsDescription>

They then had Domino come out to testify against Deadpool which ended being a trick the whole time. Domino killed the guards and Deadpool went to kill the judge revealing that he was hired to kill him and kill the drug lords and was arrested as a way of killing two birds with one stone. Then Deadpool and Domino escaped which then revealed that all of this wasn't real, that Wade Wilson is the man the judge explained earlier and that the judge was actually a worker for the mental asylum Wade was in.</hero:alternateVersionsDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Wade Wilson is a man shrouded in mystery. For instance: Wade Wilson may not be his real name and his back story may have been stolen (in-continuity) from another character. He remembers a mother who died of cancer when he was five, another mother who beat him during his teen years. He remembers a father who abandoned him in his childhood-years and yet another father who died in a bar room altercation when he was 17. That father was a good man but a military man whom was very strict with Wade, to whom Wade rebelled. He was shot by one of Wade's friends, which caused Wade to be filled with remorse. The final father is the only one who is definitely real, all the other snatches and fragments of memories may be the result of his broken psyche. It is later revealed that the various conflicting memories of his family were implanted by a man named Butler, and that Deadpool had actually been forced to kill his own family while under Butler's control.He remembers an upbringing in Ohio, but even he recognizes that this may not be true. This mysterious young man joined and quickly excelled in military service, or at least the combat side of service. The strict hierarchy and rules didn't jibe with the young man's sense of self and his absolute need to rebel against authority figures, clearly military life was not for him and he was dishonorably discharged. The military did teach him two things: he was good at killing and he enjoyed it, so he quickly found work as a mercenary, though at first he only took on targets who he felt deserved to die.Eventually he wound up in Japan as a Yakuza enforcer where he fell in love with one of the boss' daughters. The young man's mind was already in a state of radical instability, though, and he knew the relationship could never be, so he returned to America and ditched his previous moral code in addition to changing his entire identity, even his appearance, after each failed mission, fracturing his mind even more severely.When an ordinary couple stumbled upon the wounded mercenary in the woods, they took him into their home. The woman even nurses him back to health but again his unstable mind strikes, and he becomes enamored with the young woman and envious of her life with her husband. So he burns their house down and kills her husband before accidentally killing her too. He takes the name Wade Wilson and believes himself to be the dead woman's husband, but still returns to the mercenary trade. It was later found out in the Cable/Deadpool series, that this story was a lie and that Deadpool is the real Wade Wilson.It's at this stage in his life that he meets the shape-shifting prostitute Vanessa Carlysle. The young couple quickly fall in love, both of them tainted by pasts they'd rather forget. Wilson's possibly idyllic life is shattered, however, when he contracts cancer and leaves Vanessa because he doesn't want to burden her with his failing health.</hero:storyDescription>

Wilson built up his reputation working with the mechanized man Garrison Kane, fellow mercenary Sluggo and the suspicious Greg Teraerton. When Teraerton began to exhibit psychotic tendencies, Wilson killed him and was kicked out of Department H. He was sent to a facility called the Hospice and within that facility came under the dubious care of Dr. Ermys Killbrew's "workshop", a place for failed experiments. After being experimented upon multiple times, Wade is repeatedly visited by a hooded woman who comforts him and, after multiple visits, he falls in love with her. However the woman, it turns out, is the physical embodiment of Death, who Wade sees and can communicate with because he's so close to dying.Wanting to join Death he began taunting and defying his guards, hoping they would have him killed, but all the lead guard Ajax did was gladly sent him in for more of Killbrew's excruciating tests. The guards began to bet on when patients would die next and threw their money into a 'dead pool', the winner of which would win the pot. To Ajax and Wade's dismay, he continued to survive and Ajax wasn't authorized to kill a patient unless that patient had killed another. When Wade finally attacks Ajax, the guard responds with incredible brutality, but accidentally triggers Wilson's healing factor, allowing the mercenary to escape with a few of his fellow inmates. He mockingly dubbed himself 'Deadpool' and went back to his mercenary lifestyle. Sometime later, it is revealed Deadpool has become a father.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">It soon becomes clear that Wade's healing factor is flawed, as it allows him to heal faster than his cancer can kill him, hideously disfiguring him. Since his cells are in constant flux, his brain is unstable, contributing to his madness. As a costumed mercenary, Deadpool frequents the horrific Hell House, where he receives assignments. Eventually Tolliver, the man who runs the hangout, sends Deadpool to kill Cable. The mercenary fails when his attack is thwarted by Domino (who is actually his old girlfriend Copycat [Vanessa Carlyle] posing as Domino with a counter mission to blow up Cable's whole X-Force team; a mission sanctioned by Tolliver himself). Cable and X-Force, including the fake Domino, mail Deadpool back to Tolliver.Deadpool becomes Tolliver's lap dog. Deadpool runs various operations on behalf of his employer, like overseeing the shipping of dangerous goods. Garrison Kane, on behalf of the Canadian government, breaks up this operation but lets Deadpool teleport away when he gets distracted by the appearance of G.W. Bridge. He next is sent to the World Trade Center to abduct Black Tom Cassidy who had just been thoroughly shot by Cable. Deadpool also gets Black Tom's partner the Juggernaut to accompany them to Tolliver's. There, Black Tom is operated on and infused with plant life. Black Tom would later leave Tolliver's house.Deadpool's next mission from Tolliver is more personal - he's to track down Vanessa, impersonating Domino within the ranks of X-Force, and find out why she hasn't completed her mission. He infiltrates the X-Force base in the Adirondack Mountains and engages her in a royal tussle. He defeats her and convinces her to finish her job for Tolliver and then to rejoin the team. Vanessa is found by Cable and she continues to lie by stating that she is Domino but was hired by Tolliver to kill him. Cable then takes the fight to Tolliver. Deadpool protects his boss by stabbing Vanessa and then going one-on-one with Cable. Deadpool loses and passes out. Once Cable leaves to kill Tolliver (after finding and freeing the real Domino) in a helicopter explosion, Deadpool awakens to find that Vanessa has slinked off. He begins to hunt for her.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Deadpool heads to Sarajevo to rendezvous with his pal Weasel. Outside his safe-house awaits a bunch of mercenaries. Deadpool gets the drop on them and takes them out easily. Inside, Weasel informs Deadpool that he is a wanted man. Since Tolliver's death, a rumor has circulated about a will that leaves all of Tolliver's assets to the last man standing from his former empire. Being such a prominent member of Tolliver's operations, Deadpool is a marked man. Deadpool is less interested in the will and mainly wants to find Copycat. Before he gets any answers, however, Garrison Kane shows up and starts a fight. He is also looking for Copycat and won't back down until he finds her. It's a few minutes into a very intense fight before Weasel pipes in and reminds the both of them that neither of them actually knows where Copycat is at that time. As a piece of goodwill, Kane informs Deadpool that an old friend is back and looking to kill Deadpool: Slayback.With a growing interest in Tolliver's will, Deadpool looks up a man named Mr. Gezdbadah, an informant with a very special briefcase. He finds Gezdbadah fleeing from some mercenaries that Deadpool takes out easily. Gezdbadah is more than happy to pass along the briefcase, which contains a disc with information about the Tolliver will. The case is immediately taken by the Juggernaut and Black Tom Cassidy before Deadpool can inspect the disc. Deadpool and Weasel track the two men to a commercial plane and Deadpool boards it and confronts the men. Black Tom blasts Deadpool. Deadpool responds by blowing up the plane's hatch, sucking Black Tom out of the plane. Deadpool catches him with a rope and blackmails Juggernaut in giving up the briefcase. Juggernaut does so easily and Deadpool lets Black Tom go. The Juggernaut jumps out of the plane after him. Deadpool then announces that the plane has been officially hijacked.His life was forever changed when he teamed with erstwhile X-member Siryn to hunt down Black Tom Cassidy. In Siryn, he found a woman strong enough to endure the constant pitfalls of his dangerous life, but with a heart kind enough to see past his madness. Though Siryn didn't feel romantically drawn to 'Pool, he treasured their friendship enormously.</hero:storyDescription>

Even more shocking would be Mercedes' return from the dead. Wade views this as a chance for redemption. The mystical mercenary T-Ray confronts Deadpool, claiming that he can't find it with her since Deadpool isn't her husband, T-Ray is. Deadpool launches into a pitched battle against the sorcerer, who manages to get the better of 'Pool by forcing him to confront all the people he's killed.

To prove it, they injected him with a serum that temporarily fixed his skin deformities. They required Wade to prove himself first. They made him accompany Garrison Kane to Iowa to track a powerful new mutant. Kane killed the child for being too risky, angering Wade.This got The Director to trust Wade, though. His next mission was to bring in his old girlfriend, Copycat. Wade was reluctant, but he knew if anyone else was sent, they would just kill her. He agreed to bring her in even though he planned on rescuing her. Unfortunately, Kane followed him and attacked as soon as he found Vanessa. The two of them got into a big fight after Wade got Vanessa to safety. Once Kane was defeated, Wade returned to Vanessa, only to find her dead with the words 'Sabretooth was here' written in her blood on the wall.Vengeful, Wade geared up to take the fight to Weapon X. He killed a number of the security goons, but when Weapon X fixed his scars, they also changed his healing factor. It began to destabilize causing him to liquify, leaving behind only a hand.

That is when T-Ray shows up to kill Deadpool again.T-Ray attaches the Gemini Star to Deadpool causing more versions to jump out of him including his inner child and his feminine side. T-Ray was trying to exorcize all of Wade's interesting personality quirks, rendering him a boring shell of a man. The Gemini Star backfired when a homeless ally of Wade's vomited on it.

Swan suggested a three way mind meld to fix all of their memory problems, but Swan accidentally revealed he was planning to kill them both.

Cable and Deadpool fight but due to a teleportation error, the two are linked and one cannot teleport without teleporting the other thus it's like the expression "You scratch my back and I scratch yours". Although they start out as enemies and find it amazingly difficult to be in each others presence, the two manage to become somewhat of uneasy allies after some time. Deadpool is there when Cable constructs his own island nation. Deadpool, after some time, accepts Cable's offer to join him on his island and the two become real friends, although neither of them would ever admit it. Deadpool even tells Cable about his origin, how he was the son of a military dad, and how Wade got in with the wrong kind of friends.One of them, eventually killed his dad when he tried to take Wade out of a bar. Deadpool gets inspired by Cable's way of life and tries to become a better person, stopping his former violent ways. This works out to some extend, but Cable and Deadpool clashed numerous times after that. One of their largest fights was when Wade sided with the pro-registration act group of superheroes during the Superhuman Civil War. Cable eventually took reign over the small European country known as Rumekistan. Deadpool was hired by the government of that country to stop this from happening and even shot Cable in the back.Cable however managed to stop the bullet and defeated Deadpool and his teammates of other mercenaries. He then joined with Cable once again, this time vowing to stop his unnecessary violent ways. During one mission, Deadpool took an agent of Hydra named Bob hostage. The two made it out alive and soon Bob became somewhat of a sidekick and friend to Deadpool whenever he appears in the comics. Not soon after this, Cable vanished during an attack by the newly reformed Marauders right before the events of the Messiah Complex. Cable's city was destroyed and Deadpool feared the worst for his good friend.Cable however later resurfaced when he tried to safe-keep the first baby mutant that was born since M-Day. Deadpool found out about Cable's mission and aided him in keeping the baby safe. They where attacked by various advisories such as the Marauders, the Purifiers and even some creatures named Predator X. After this, Cable made Deadpool promise to stop following him, and he told him that they would see each-other again. This however turned out not to be true. Cable was killed during the events of Second Coming. Deadpool was devastated. His former greatest enemy and now best friend was no more. He went back to Rumekistan (at least the thought it was Rumekistan) and tried to honor Cable by making the country a better nation.</hero:storyDescription>

Grilling his old ally Preston for his location led Wade right to him, but it also earned suspicions from Preston. For the good of Captain America's mission, he killed both of them regrettably. He also joined Hydra's version of the Avengers, thinking Cap was impeachable, but after fighting the heroes in the Underground, Wade finally started having reservations. He ultimately slipped the information Maria Hill needed to free the captured heroes, but lacking trust in him, Hill buried him under a parking garage.With Hydra fallen and a righteous Captain America returned while Deadpool was still pulling himself out of the rubble, Deadpool missed his chance for a legit public redemption. Instead, he is responsible for the deaths of two of his friends and is now hated by his daughter for it. Ridden with guilt, he put a bounty on his own head, hoping to be taken out, but no one was capable of killing him permanently. Desperate, he had his mind wiped, losing not just his tenure as Hydra-Cap's personal assassin but much of his time as a hero.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When the Monster King took advantage of a centuries old land claim to turn Staten Island into the new Monster Island, a rich New York elite hired Deadpool to take out the Monster King. When he accomplished this, per the rules of Monster Island, Deadpool was now the rightful heir to the throne. Rather than let Staten Island revert back like his employer intended, Deadpool decided to take the crown and protect the inhabitants of Monster Island.Deadpool wasn't the only mercenary hired to take out the Monster King though. Elsa Bloodstone was also hired, however, she was impressed by the honor and nobility Deadpool displayed by protecting the monsters. She stuck around to help, and they even started developing feelings for each other. Among his tasks as King of the Monsters, Deadpool helped Strikeforce by giving the Vridai sanctuary after they lost their homes during the War of the Realms. He also defended his people from the new Kraven the Hunter who came looking for a new challenge.Elsa ultimately revealed to him that she was dying due to an infection in the bloodgem that gave her her powers. The infection was caused by a run-in with a Bone Beast Queen. Together, they tracked it to Greenland, where a village was sacrificing their children to it. To take out the Bone Beasts, Deadpool stole Elsa's bloodgem, allowing the energy to fill him up and explode. Elsa, who had gotten the sacrificed children to safety, returned to find Deadpool's conscious head, which she took into her protection until he could fully recuperate.</hero:storyDescription>

As he made his escape from the prison, he was stopped by Juggernaut and his new team, The Unstoppables, who got the mutant back to Krakoa.When Deadpool found out that The Warden intended to copy Rubber Maid's powers and may have already copied his own, Deadpool allied with Juggie's new team. Although, he wasn't too crazy about working with Zola, a Nazi, he still went with their plan to shoot down The Warden's flying lab. Unfortunately, The Warden granted himself all of the powers he has collected, turning himself into the Human Adaptoid.He and Juggie made their way to Krakoa, where the entire population was put into a coma by the Human Adaptoid on his quest to rid the world of superhumans. Deadpool's plan was to try to outlast the Warden before his powers burned out. When his psychic powers went before his others, Juggernaut used the opportunity to get Xavier to wake D-Cel, so she could use her powers to stop the Warden's. Once inactive, Deadpool was able to kill him.</hero:storyDescription>

Even though he is not a mutant, he always felt at home with them. He tried a number of different ways to sneak on to the island, most of which were foiled by X-Force. Instead, he decided to prove himself by taking on a gig to retrieve Cerebro tech from a CIA agent before Danger, who was no longer an ally of the X-Men, grabbed it. Deadpool also tried to force a team up with Wolverine, but he ended up getting both of them targeted by Weasel and Maverick, who had teamed up to scam them out of the tech.After they finally tracked down Danger, they found that she had surrounded herself with robot doubles of the X-Men, and she was using the Cerebro tech to create herself a baby. She was lonely and resentful of the X-Men for abandoning her for Krakoa. Empathetic, both Wade and Logan decide to leave her to her new family.The duo head back to Krakoa, where Deadpool peaks his head in on an X-Force meeting and is graciously invited on to the team by Wolverine.</hero:storyDescription>

Wade couldn't help but annoy Red into attacking him. While Omega Red took on the traffickers, a defenseless Wade was eaten by a polar bear, only to be found partially digested by Kraven the Hunter. While still assembling himself, Wade is interrogated by Kraven and spills the beans that he has special gate privileges despite his lack of an X-gene. This inspires Kraven to turn him into an organic key.Once they were on the island, Kraven discards Deadpool's remain to hunt other mutants. Now that they have the resurrection protocols, Kraven sees them as the new apex predator, perfect for a challenge. Under orders from Beast, Black Tom went in search of Deadpool, who would be needed to fight off Kraven. Not willing to wait for Deadpool's body to grow back, Black Tom created a telefloronic one for Wade to use in the meantime.Unfortunately, this new vegetable body was unable to withstand the lifelike volcanic activity in The Shadow Room, X-Force's personal Danger Room, where Kraven made his stand. Wolverine refused his chance to kill Kraven, seeing no honor in it, and retreated rescuing Wade in the process.</hero:storyDescription>

To prove himself, he is given 48 hours to kill Doctor Octopus. However, he is kidnapped by super scientist, The Harrower, who used Deadpool as an incubator for a symbiote clone. This clone is eventually born taking the shape of a giant dog and named Princess by Deadpool. When Princess chooses Deadpool over Harrower, Harrower tries to destroy it. Deadpool and Princess fight back but are also rescued by other Atelier hopeful, Lady Deathstrike and Deadpool's new girlfriend, Valentine Vuong, a mutant medical professional and Wade's contact at The Atelier.When the rest of The Atelier find out about Valentine's relationship with Deadpool, they brand her as 'compromised.' The head of The Atelier, The Horned Emperor, assigns all members to take the two of them out. The assassins attacked in pairs, but the first few proved ineffective. Deadpool and Valentine luckily had backup from Princess and Deathstrike. This only managed to get Princess on The Horned Emperor's radar, who now demanded that his fellow assassins kidnap the dog in addition to killing their targets. Alcaud'n and Ms. Gingko were finally able to best the two lovers and their dog.Once taken prisoner, Wade put together that Valentine had set up his audition for the group from the beginning. She needed his help to take out the immortal Horned Emperor and free Valentine of The Atelier organization for good. Valentine didn't expect to also fall in love with Wade as well. They plan another prison break where Wade is able to help Valentine strike the killing blow on The Horned Emperor, turning Val into the new Horned Emperor. Val was immediately overwhelmed by the voices she inherited from her former boss, but Wade's feelings for Val anchored them, clearing their head. With The Atelier gone, Wade, Val, and Princess become a new happy family.</hero:storyDescription>

Deadpool breaks the fourth wall by talking about his own comic (sometimes even having copies of it somehow), referring to artists or writers or even the reader, and discussing comics in general. He is most known for, however, talking to the yellow narration bubbles that his comic has. There have been several theories as to what the boxes really are but no one other than Deadpool can see them in continuity and therefore many people in the Marvel Universe think Deadpool is crazy. Deadpool also references popular media culture in the comics such as video games, celebrities, social networking, and what's going on with the real world at the time.</hero:powerDescription>

T-Ray, whom Deadpool calls the "the-loathe-of-my-life," isn't just a fellow mercenary and jealous jerkass out to kill Deadpool as a professional rival. T-Ray targets Deadpool's supporting characters, enlists Typhoid Mary who bed tricks Deadpool, publicly kicks Deadpool's ass after he's traumatized by Typhoid, plays vicious headgames, and in the Twist Ending to Joe Kelly's run claims to be the real Wade Wilson. And he wears a stupid bandage on his nose. In Deadpool's backstory, Dr. Killebrew used Wade as a human test subject with the sadistic assistance of his strongarm Francis Fanny aka Ajax film In the first Deadpool film, he and Dr. Killebrew became the composite character renamed Francis Freeman aka Ajax. Wade was Driven to Suicide by the unending medical torture and fell in love with Death herself, but his repeated attempts to "join" her were thwarted to keep him alive for more experiments. Then Wade realized he could provoke "Francis" into killing him. It worked too well; Ajax murdered other patients to torment Wade, then ripped out Wade's heart. Wade's desire for vengeance kept him from Death's embrace; his heart regenerated, but his sanity was broken. Wade became "Deadpool" and seemingly killed Ajax. In Kelly's Deadpool run, Ajax resurfaces and kills Deadpool— but Deadpool has Purpose-Driven Immortality to kill Ajax. Wade's old murdered friends believe Deadpool's vendetta is their Unfinished Business, and they goad him into dropping his ongoing non-murdering hero attempts so he'll fulfill his destiny and kill Ajax. Years later, Francis comes back again when Thanos and Deadpool clash over Death. Madcap and Deadpool are both unstable pranksters with regenerative powers. However, Madcap's even crazier and has a much better healing factor than Wade. Madcap's mind accidentally gets fused into Deadpool's after Thor lightning-zaps them into ashes (It Makes Sense in Context). Unbeknownst to Deadpool, the new "white caption box" voice in his mind is actually Madcap inside him. After being literally separated from Deadpool, the experience harmed Madcap in a way he never felt before. Developing a deep, personal hatred of Wade, Madcap became obsessed with completely destroying Deadpool's life and loved ones. After framing him for murders he didn't commit, very nearly killing his daughter, and several of his closest friends, Deadpool hated Madcap to an even greater extent than his past arch enemies and people like the Weapon X program and Sabertooth (who Wade believed murdered his past family). By the time Deadpool finally gets rid of Madcap, the latter doesn't mind simply because Wade himself has already managed to completely ruin his own life, with Madcap declaring the actual death he was going to give to Wade's family wholly inferior to the spiritual one Wade himself gave them.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool is known as the famous Merc with the Mouth, one of Marvel's most popular characters, with his movie franchise being even more successful than the X-Men themselves. With his massive following, merchandise, sales and surrounding culture, it might be hard to believe that when he was introduced, he was not the famous Anti-Hero we know him for, but rather a villain. Furthermore, Rob Liefeld created him as nothing more than a Captain Ersatz of Deathstroke, being a run of the mill Gun And Sword-wielding Super-Soldier mercenary who tangled with the New Mutants and had practically none of the personality we know him for now. It was when other writers like Joe Kelly began diversifying his characterization that he became as popular as he is today. Back then, no one could've expected how popular Deadpool would've ended up being, considering he's now bigger than all the New Mutants put together. Even Cable himself, who was intended from the start to be a big deal to the X-Men franchise and ended up as an even bigger deal than Liefeld ever imagined, ultimately got eclipsed by Deadpool's popularity. The 2004 Cable &amp; Deadpool series started out with Cable as the lead character and Deadpool as his sidekick, but by 2008 it was Deadpool who was the undisputed main character, and the book was cancelled in favor of a new Deadpool solo book.</hero:tropeDescription>

Hilariously, unlike the description given above, he actually is Ax-Crazy...which makes him a whole lot of fun. He also strays into Crazy Is Cool sometimes; for example, when he fights with absolutely no semblance of sense, not even deciding what an attack is going to be until it connects, to beat the Taskmaster. However, Taskmaster himself called Deadpool out for this, telling him that one of the reasons he's not taken seriously and doesn't make nearly as much money as he could is because he's so crazy that it's even more crazy for people to think they can rely on him. Hell, in some of his earliest incarnations, he would change sides in the middle of a fight if he was offered more money. If you have a hopeless suicide mission, call Deadpool. If you need subtlety and discretion, stay light-years away from him. Also, since Deadpool has developed a conscience and tries to do the right thing, there's no guarantee that he won't turn on someone who just paid him if he thinks the situation warrants it.</hero:tropeDescription>

After his character development, Deadpool lampshaded this and used it as an excuse for why he hadn't appeared in a Marvel/DC Crossover. When he finally appeared in one, guess who he encountered... In tribute to this origin, Joe Kelly (Deadpool's first ongoing writer) wrote a story where the Earth-3 Deathstroke acts like and is implied to be Deadpool. In Deathstroke's own early 90s book, a "long lost half-brother" named "Wade Le Farge" (Forge? Farce?) showed up wanting to become Deathstroke and take away everything that belonged to him in gruesomely irrational fashion.</hero:tropeDescription>

Bush as his own president, talks about growing up in Ohio, and more. The Canadian government that gave him his healing factor isn't his own. But then in 2008, as if Deadpool and his readers got kicked in the head by a retconning moose, he's Canadian-born, Canadian-bred, proud to be Canadian, is confused about historic American presidents but knows all of Canada's prime ministers, and is now included on lists of famous fictional Canadians and portrayed in live-action films by Canadian Ryan Reynolds.</hero:tropeDescription>

His Cloudcuckoolander tendencies and ability to both shake off bodily harm and make a joke of it tend to obscure the fact that he is an immortal, unstoppable, superhuman killing-machine with a penchant for inventively torturing and/or brutally slaughtering anyone who manages to get on his bad side. In the Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe miniseries, he singlehandedly slaughters nearly every superhero and villain on the planet. This is caused when Psycho-Man fiddled with Deadpool's brain until something clicked, turning him into the perfect killing machine with a penchant for nihilism. He resolves to destroy reality itself, believing that it never mattered anyway, due to him being aware that he is a comic book character. This is proof that he isn't just capable of fighting A-list Marvel heroes and villains, he is capable of murdering every single one with ease.</hero:tropeDescription>

He eventually came to view it as just another form of ugliness. Deadpool gets this again, in a sort of subversion. In Deadpool #64, Thanos curses him with immortality. Where's the curse in that? Well, they both love Death, so Deadpool would actually be pretty happy being killable.

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> During the first ongoing Deadpool series and in Cable &amp; Deadpool, Deadpool was a talkative loon full of bad jokes and other wackiness. However, he was also portrayed as a total psychotic with a loose, at best, grasp of sanity. All the wackiness was a cover to hide his immense mental problems and self-loathing and just the slightest nudge could send him over the edge in a violent, unsettling rage. Most subsequent writers pretty much ignore the latter part and play him up as little more than a goofy comedy character. His popularity skyrocketed after his flanderization and his flanderized version became his more iconic and well-recognized version. It helps that Marvel already has characters to fill the Canadian with Rage Issues, Regenerating Healing Powers, and a convoluted backstory complicated by Swiss-Cheese Memory, and a flamboyant joke-cracker in a red costume, whose snark covers up his inner angst roles. After Deadpool's flanderized "wacky all the time" shtick got stale with many fans, the Duggen/Posehn run achieved acclaim for its Character Rerailment.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool is known for being able to see through the fourth wall and snap it in two if he wants to. The reasoning is because he's a very special kind of insane, which occasionally allows him to perceive things others cannot. From being able to see the yellow boxes that he thinks in, to referring to the last time he showed up by issue number, Deadpool's odd observations are even occasionally plot points; for example, Deadpool is unaffected by Marvel's recent massive retcon of the past twenty years of Spider-Man's history, leaving some fans to speculate it was put there as an editorial escape plan if necessary. Fabian Nicieza usually makes a recap page that isn't in continuity, which means that blobs like the Blob can break the fourth wall at will during the recap page. One Cable &amp; Deadpool recap page had Cable hinting to Deadpool that he has infected Deadpool with subliminal messages. Since this recap page wasn't in continuity, Deadpool didn't know about the meeting, which didn't stop him from, in the story, saying these words</hero:tropeDescription>

The only problem is, his brain is constantly in flux as a result, which is why he's... unstable. Deadpool is... thrilled to meet up with Alex Hayden (Agent X), who can also regenerate. Deadpool shows his affection by spelling out messages with Alex's entrails, and also stealing his pancreas just because he can. Deadpool has jumped face first into concrete from a 10 story building to try to "fix" looking like Tom Cruise. That's Thom Cruz. Deadpool has also jumped into a malfunctioning nuclear reactor to stop it from going nuclear. In Cable &amp; Deadpool, Cable's preferred method of getting Deadpool to leave him alone, at least at first, is to telekinetically blow up his brain, resulting in a nasty-looking head wound and Deadpool being down for about an hour.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool got Wolverine's healing factor from the same place Wolverine got his adamantium skeleton, but since he had cancer before getting it, his healing factor caused the tumors to grow out of control and made him horribly scarred and insane (he thinks he's a character in a comic book). He has noted that he couldn't come back from the silly lengths that Wolverine has managed — although he can regrow fast enough that his friend Cable would psychically make his head explode for a joke. Deadpool's blown himself up and then been dragged back to the X-Men Mansion by Colossus in a sack of body parts, complaining all the way. He's been liquefied and drunk by Cable. And he's decapitated on a fairly regular basis. During the Secret Invasion, Deadpool actually weaponized his healing factor by letting the Skrulls use it to make their next generation of Super Skrulls. We then find out that if it wasn't for Deadpool's deadly cancer constantly killing him, his healing factor would be completely out of control. The Super Skrulls keep generating more and more body mass until they explode. Deadpool's daughter Ellie has a variation. After death, her body "reboots" back into the age when her mutant ability first emerged, with her memories intact.</hero:tropeDescription>

Yet all of his love interests are extremely hot women. Deadpools claims to have been married at least ten times previously in Vol. 5 #27 "The Wedding of Deadpool", although not all of these stories may be accurate since he is an Unreliable Narrator. The past wives listed include Ms. Marvel  turned out she was being controlled by an alien at the time, a sock puppet of Copycat he hallucinated was really her after he thought she died  destroyed, although the real Copycat was still alive, a stripper calling herself Genosha  killed during the wedding as a consequence of Deadpool messing with continuity, a woman whose name he forgot that he assassinated by pretending to be her groom  she actually hired him to make her suicide look like a murder, a woman named Penny  she didn't exist, she was part of a trap set by a villain, a woman named Anna  he had actually killed the real Anna and married Copycat pretending to be her and it turned out the people who married them were replaced with actors so it didn't count, a Dumb Blonde named Lurleen  divorced when it turned out she was actually Mystique, Outlaw  her super strength made sex extremely painful, so probably divorced, Domino  only pretending to be a couple for a mission but Deadpool took it like it was real, and she "divorced" him by shooting through him to get the bad guy, AIM assassin Betty Swanson  didn't count, she was unconscious and the guy doing the wedding was a savage land native shaman that he coerced, and a large alien woman named Orksa  although it didn't show it in this comic, he later divorced her so she could be with somebody who loved her more than he did, and of course, the main story of the issue is him getting married to Shiklah the Succubus  but they have since separated, with Shiklah marrying Dracula like originally intended after their marriage falls apart due to Wade's negligence. Deadpool mentions in issue 31 of volume 4, that he thinks they're still technically married, but isn't sure how it works with her -being a Succubus There are also all the women he had sex with but didn't marry,  one of which had his daughter. However, may be deconstructed since Deadpool sometimes never seems to remove his mask when he with some of his ladies. When having sex with Carmelita, he keeps his suit on. He has to leave to fight, and Carmelita wishes him luck and kisses him in case something bad happens to her. She even goes to the fight scene, wondering if Deadpool is ok. However, she'd never seen his face, and when she does, she chokes back bile and runs away in disgust. Granted, his face is only a mess due to injuries. When he gets his face fixed, he is quite handsome looking.</hero:tropeDescription>

This is connected to the fact that for Deadpool, there is No Fourth Wall. Indeed, the Deadpool comics became so famous for this that the dual sublines for the comic were "The Merc with a Mouth" and "Breaking down the fourth wall one brick at a time!" Earlier Deadpool books toyed with this; he didn't actually have any proof that he was in a comic book (because, let's face it, he can't perceive the reader no matter how much he tries to look outside the page) but kept up the act anyway because he believed it was true (and it was funny). This detail has since been dropped for simplicity. At one point, numerous characters tell him he is saying aloud everything that was in the yellow boxes, which leads him to suspect his "internal monologue" is broken. No one listens or responds to what he says, because he is known to be completely insane. This gag has extended to other media including Deadpool</hero:tropeDescription>

Other life experiences before becoming Deadpool or directly leading into it are told in incompatible ways. In the Twist Ending of Joe Kelly's run, Arch-Enemy T-Ray claims Deadpool was once named Jack and the real Wade was a teacher who married his high school sweetheart, Mercedes. Mercedes and Wade rescued "the monster" Jack from a frozen river, Jack wanted to change his identity into Wade's and grew obsessed with Mercedes, but accidentally killed Mercedes when disposing of Wade. This supposedly broke Deadpool's mind and confused his identity into thinking he was Wade, while the actual Wade returned to life as T-Ray. Near the end of Frank Tieri's run, Deadpool and T-Ray clash again and Deadpool seemingly kills T-Ray after getting reason to believe T-Ray's claims were all lies.

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool also uses this trope to its full advantage, confusing and exhausting his enemies and allies alike with unstoppable mouth and wacky babbling. Like the Joker, Deadpool really is insane (a different kind of insane, though) and knows it, but he plays up and (possibly) exaggerates his insanity for tactical benefit. Also like the Joker, the fact that his personality changes regularly is part of canon. In his case, his healing factor and cancer have combined to leave his braincells constantly in flux. In some stories he's little more than an immature goofball, others he's perfectly capable of committing murders in cold blood that he doesn't even remember afterward. Of course, as a Meta Guy, Deadpool's also the first to admit that the real reason he changes is who is writing him at the moment.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> While it's not always clear that he's doing it on purpose, it's been said more than once that one of Deadpool's "superpowers" is actually the ability to distract and confuse people by rambling on and on about stupid things until you either want to surrender or commit suicide from all the inanity — and yet, the whole time he's rambling, he's efficiently killing or otherwise getting on with whatever task is at hand. Often people underestimate him as a complete idiot because of all the talking, although occasionally someone will say he's an idiot but not underestimate his fighting abilities. For example, his irritating, non-sequitur monologuing and erratic behavior is exactly why he could beat the crap out of The Taskmaster. Not only because Taskmaster became so irritated by the constant flood of inanity that he got all distracted, but also because he couldn't copy Deadpool's unpredictability and insanity. And Deadpool knew precisely what he was doing by unleashing it in spades. But yeah, mostly he's just nuts. During Civil War, he used the phrase "addled moron that I am (or pretend to be)". This being Deadpool, it's entirely possible the "or" should be taken at face value, and he's genuinely too crazy to know how intelligent he is at any given moment. Deadpool also says to Cable in the Cable and Deadpool comic something along the lines of "It's fun playing the fool, but do you know when it stops being fun? When you actually start to believe it." In their first encounter, Taskmaster is detailing Deadpool's skills and abilities for a group of his students and states that Deadpool is an expert at using banter to distract his opponents.</hero:tropeDescription>

On the rare occasions where his speech bubbles go to the normal white shading, meaning he's taking things seriously, you know it's significant. The plot of Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe involves the yellow and white voices getting somehow killed... and the red voice replacing it. Let's just say it doesn't go well for the world. Also anytime you don't see the yellow and white voice boxes, and Deadpool is acting calm, you're going to die horribly, because you did something even Deadpool thinks is monstrous, and he's doing this job pro bono.</hero:tropeDescription>

Spider-Man's alternate version is a Well-Intentioned Extremist, which annoys Spidey. Deadpool gets along famously with his alternate until he discovers that alt-Deadpool isn't Wade Wilson, it's Victor Von Doom. Alt-Wade Wilson is a Big Bad who Deadpool takes down. Bruce Banner discovers that he can't turn into the Hulk in this dimension and is overjoyed, until that gets reversed. Then alt-Hulk and Hulk duke it out. One nice example involving Deadpool has him inventing an imaginary version of himself (aka, he willed himself into having a split personality) while trapped inside a room for over 800 years (long story). Why did he do this? To have someone to play hangman with of course. His plan fails when the imaginary Deadpool turns out to be a genius and starts totally kicking Deadpool's ass in the game.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool's appearance was horrific when it was first seen, due to the artificial origin of his healing factor reacting with incurable cancer. Over time, it changed and simplified from "bubbles and nodules of flesh with random hair" to "flesh-coloured de-uglified Ben Grimm", and some artists go even further. In Cable &amp; Deadpool, about 75% of his skin actually looked perfectly normal, with the rest just resembling bad acne. Didn't stop people from nearly retching when they saw him on the street. This is another that goes back and forth depending on who's drawing him, since sometimes he looks alright, others he's back to his horrific look. Since his power has been described as leaving his body tissue in constant, dynamic flux, this makes sense. There was a time he was given the face of Thom Cruz, and spent most of the issue trying to get rid of it.</hero:tropeDescription>

T-Ray claims the "real" Wade was a teacher, unlike the monstrous mercenary "Jack" who became Deadpool. This clashed with Deadpool's previous Weapon X origin written by the same writer. A different writer in same series retconned the retcon with a ham-handed explanation that T-Ray was tricking Deadpool to mess with his head; the Weapon X story and the name Wade Wilson became his origin again. Most fans didn't even remember this mess until T-Ray's version was restated as false in Cable &amp; Deadpool, written by Deadpool co-creator Fabian Nicieza.

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> As Deadpool features a lot of both meta-commentary and time travel, this tends to come up in his book. The best example is when he gets set into the past to Amazing Spider-Man #47, and infiltrates himself into the story, Forrest Gump style.note Deadpool vol 3 #11 All the panels and dialogue are drawn in John Romita's style, and all the characters (except Deadpool and friends) talk like Stan Lee wrote them. (Indeed, enough panels are lifted from the original work that Romita and Lee are credited as co-authors.) In case you're wondering why specifically Spider-Man, it's because Deadpool's costume bears no small resemblance to that of the ol' Webhead, meaning it was a snap to redraw Spidey as 'Pool. Deadpool vol 5 #7 (from the Duggan and Posehn run) is supposedly an inventory story from 1979, crossing Deadpool (who, of course, didn't exist at the time to write inventory stories about) into the Iron Man "Demon in a Bottle" storyline, with 70s Spidey and the Power Pack also making appearances. The art and writing style both reflect this, and it even has oversaturated Bronze Age colouring. Later issues in that run follow on from this, having Deadpool show up in what are claimed to be inventory stories from other eras, with the writing and art in the style of those periods. Including one from Deadpool's actual early days, with a Rob Liefeld in-joke as the characters have everything possible hiding their feet.</hero:tropeDescription>

Uncanny Avengers has Rogue and Deadpool playing this trope big time. Rogue couldn't stand him at first, but they slowly developed a genuine bond -enough so that Wade takes Rogue to see his daughter, whom he asks Rogue to watch over if she becomes a mutant. Rogue readily agrees to have Ellie's back. In addition to shared moments here and there between the two that hint at deeper feelings. It finally comes to a head in chapter 22, when Rogue gives him The Big Damn Kiss. Afterwards, Deadpool tells her that she deserves better, and that she only likes him because she doesn't fully know him. Rogue kisses him again -unmoving in her feelings. She tells him that the stuff in his head is a relief after having Red Skull in her's. He notes that as the most romantic thing anyone's said to him. In the next panel we see them continuing their kissing elsewhere. invoked Word of God states that the two seem very lonely, and admits that while the majority were rooting for Rogue and Gambit, he wanted to try something new and unexpected. Chapter 23's recap classifies Rogue and Deadpool's evening previous chapter as their first date. However it doesn't last as Rogue goes back to Gambit when Kitty and Colossus are unable to go though with their wedding and Gambit proposes to her.

Then Dr. Killebrew experiments on and tortures him to the point of having visions of (and falling in love with) Death. What finally demolishes his sanity is when Killebrew orders him killed, his healing factor finally kicks in, saving his life, making his disfigurement permanent, and causing Death to reject him. Depending on the writer, he's a mix of Ax-Crazy, Deadpan Snarker, gleeful Genre Savvy, and Medium Awareness. Another issue is that the Healing Factor is connected to his cancer — he's basically an immortal living cancer. The constant state of flux and strain this places on him (including his brain) is why he's so unstable.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Since the late 2000s, Deadpool began rivaling good ol' Wolverine himself as Marvel's Poster Child with multiple simultaneous comic books of his own plus so-called guest appearances that are sometimes with characters he's never met or just for a single panel. Within one year (Fall '08–Fall '09) alone, he was granted three of his own ongoing titles (more than Iron Man and Captain America combined) and a confirmed place as a regular character in X-Force, given his first animated speaking role (Hulk vs. Wolverine), confirmed as making his first speaking television debut (Season 2 of The Super Hero Squad Show), made one of the most prominent characters of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, ... errr... "featured" in a live-action film, and later rebooted in a new timeline.  In 2010, there was a Marvel Team-Up between Deadpool and It the Living Colossus. For all that Deadpool actually did to help, it was basically an It one-shot. It seems Deadpool's role in this team-up was just to get people to buy the book. Sorry, did we say Marvel Team-Up? Our mistake — the book's called Deadpool Team-Up. Yes, Deadpool was the star of a Marvel Team-Up book — meaning Marvel editorial already considered Deadpool a flagship character. Oh, and Deadpool Team-Up started with issue 900 and counts down from there. Granted, this was a joke about the then-current release of Action Comics 900 — the series got canned after a little over a year. Similar to the Wolverine variant covers, Deadpool was for one month featured on numerous variant covers, though the series were mainly in the Marvel Universe. The covers ranged from slight alterations of the original covers to parodies of classic covers (One Amazing Spider-Man cover parodied Amazing Spider-Man Annual #21, and featured Deadpool smoozing up Mary-Jane and pushing Spidey out of the way) to at least one completely original cover. He's prominently displayed on most of the artwork for Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and shown opposite Dante in the intro. His eventual burst of popularity is lampshaded by She-Hulk in the game, who annoyedly points out to Deadpool that in the 80s and early 90s she was very popular and even shared his signature fourth-wall-breaking powers. In 2013, Deadpool got his own video game. The last line of the teaser trailer? "Suck it, Wolverine!" He's also given a prominent position on the promo◊ for the LEGO Marvel Super Heroes game, right up there with the cast of The Avengers movie, Spider-Man, and you guessed it, Wolverine. In this interview, the writer of the 2010 Ant-Man and the Wasp miniseries felt the need to specify that neither Wolverine nor Deadpool appears in it.

  <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Wade Wilson was played by Ryan Reynolds in his pre-mutated form (his mutated form was doubled mutely by Reynolds and stuntman Scott Adkins). The movie was faithful to the snarkiness and sarcasm of the character, but nothing was mentioned about his cancer nor his fourth-wall breaking. It's unknown if he was a mutant in the continuity of the film, but he displayed superhuman reflexes and skills, such as his ability to deflect bullets with his swords. He was a member of Team X, the Weapon X group of mercenaries along with Wolverine, Sabretooth, Wraith, Bolt, Agent Zero and Fred Dukes. It should be noted that in the movie, Wade Wilson does not wear the classic Deadpool outfit, but does wear a red T-shirt as a nod to his comic costume. Wade has guns here but is only seen using his katanas when in combat. Humorously, he claims that he used his katanas at his ex-girlfriend's wedding sometime before the events of the film. He is present during the mission to Africa, which is where the group first discovers adamantium. The mission ends with Wolverine leaving the group in disgust after Wade and the others inflict violence against a group of local civilians. Years later, William Stryker, the former leader of Team X, informs Wolverine that both Wade and Bolt had been murdered by Sabretooth, who has gone rogue and is now hunting down his former teammates.This turns out to be a lie, and in the film's final act, it is revealed that not only is Wade still alive, but that he has also been transformed into a superhuman killing machine known as Weapon XI. As Weapon XI, his mouth is stitched closed, all visible hair is gone, and stitch marks are still present, as he had been taken out of his procedure early to fight Wolverine. He is also infused with a variety of superpowers as a result of being given DNA injections from the various mutants Stryker had kidnapped. He is never exactly called Deadpool in the movie, however Stryker once refers to him as "the Dead Pool" in the movie. In the final battle he is able to shoot energy beams out of his eyes like Cyclops, is armed with retractable adamantium katanas from his arms, has a healing factor that heals otherwise mortal wounds in seconds, can teleport like Wraith, and is controlled technopathically through a computer by Stryker. His head is cut off by Wolverine but in a scene after the credits his charred hand is dragging itself towards the head in the rubble of the facility, whose eyes open in a conscious moan when the hand touches, hinting at the possibility of a spin-off or movie of his own.Though the pre-Weapon XI scenes were well received by fans, the film's version of Deadpool (as well as the movie itself) was highly controversial with fans, and garnered a great deal of backlash. Fans took to derisively calling the character "Barakapool" due to his resemblance to the Mortal Kombat character Baraka.</hero:mediaDescription>

On September 18, 2014, Fox announced that the movie was officially in the works for a February 2016 release date.The movie additionally starred Ed Skrein as Ajax, Morena Baccarin as Vanessa, T.J. Miller as Weasel, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, Stefan Kapicic as the voice of Colossus, Gina Carano as Angel Dust and Brianna Hildebrand as newcomer to the big-screen, Negasonic Teenage Warhead. The film was directed by Tim Miller from a script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.The plot consisted mostly of a Deadpool origin story. After being diagnosed with very aggressive cancer, lovestruck mercenary, Wade Wilson, allows a clandestine criminal thinktank to do experiments on him with the promise of curing his cancer. Instead, they torture his X-gene into activating, which gives him a superhuman healing factor that is constantly working against the fast spreading cancer, causing his body and his mind to be unstable. Afraid of what his fianc' will say about his new appearance, Wade crafts the Deadpool identity to hunt down the people who took advantage of him.The film opened to positive reviews and was a massive hit at the box office.</hero:mediaDescription>
