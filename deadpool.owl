  <hero:evolution rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Deadpool's debut marked a very different version of the character. He was a serious, grim, and professional assassin, with none of his personality trademarks intact. It would be in his solo book that his trademark character traits would finally emerge. These would include the dark randomness to his actions, his humorous bend, schizophrenic tendencies, his suicidal personal outlook, and his 4th wall breaking quips that would make him famous, along with his love for Mexican food. Recently, Deadpool has been trying to be a hero.Deadpool has been known for carrying a number of weapons and sometimes it is as if they appear from nowhere, this is often referred to as a 'magic satchel'. Blind Al is also a significant catalyst in Deadpool's personal development, as there is a clear love hate relationship which can vary from Blind Al being a mother-like figure to an abused hostage; sometimes within the same storyline.Starting with Daniel Way's run, to depict Deadpool's unstable sanity, creators started featuring POV shots of how cartoonish Deadpool saw the world and multiple narrative voices. He had at least three voices: Deadpool's insane inner monologue, a saner narrative voice of reason, and his own out loud voice. All three would argue with each other. Eventually, the extra narrative box would be ret-conned as rival Madcap through a flashback where both were destroyed, and Wade absorbed him during his healing process.As Deadpool's popularity increased, so did his prominence in the publishing line. In a meta twist, his popularity was included in-universe with Wade monetizing his own heroism. After earning the trust of both Wolverine and Captain America, he was recruited to X-men and Avengers adjacent teams. He started a friendship with Spider-Man and was often featured as a guest star across multiple books. After ruining his in-universe reputation during the Secret Empire event, Deadpool's appearances dropped drastically. Ever since, his on-goings have failed to catch on, but he has found a regular main character role in the Krakoa version of X-Force.</hero:evolution>

  <hero:creation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Created by artist Rob Liefeld and writer Fabian Nicieza, Deadpool made his first appearance in The New Mutants #98 (1991). Rob Liefeld has publicly stated that he had always loved the simplicity of Spider-Man's design, and therefore designed a character with a full-head mask. Deadpool was originally a parody of DC Comics' character Deathstroke, and there are real name similarities (Deathstroke’s real name is Slade Wilson) between the two. Wade's alias "Deadpool" was taken from the fifth Dirty Harry film The Dead Pool.Another inspiration was G.I. Joe's ninja Snake-Eyes.</hero:creation>

  <hero:origin rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">David Cain trained Cassandra in isolation and kept her away from human speech, raising her on the language of motion and violence. The idea was to adapt the language centers of her brain, and train it to interpret physical movement as a language. This gifted Cassandra with superb body-reading abilities, and has made fighting her "mother tongue" so to speak. However, this upbringing has also rendered her dyslexic, and when taught to speak, with audible speech-impediments.When Cassandra was eight, Cain took her to carry out a hit in Macau. Cassandra did as her father trained and instructed her to do, and ripped out the throat of a local triad boss. Due to her body-reading ability, she was able to see how death effected the man, and was traumatized by her irreversible sin. Her father came to congratulate her, and she rejected him by delivering an emotional uppercut. Shocked, Cain did not pursue Cassandra when she fled in tears. Cassandra would then wander the Earth for the next eight years, before meeting her father once again in Gotham during No Man's Land.</hero:origin>
  <hero:origin rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Wade Wilson was born as a normal person into a highly dysfunctional family in a small town in the state of Ohio. He ran away as a teenager and bounced around the country, all the while getting military training from various sources until he decided to become a mercenary. He kept changing his identity whenever something went wrong with the mission. He moved to Canada where he met a man by the name of Wade T. Wilson. Since he was Wade W. Wilson, the name reminded him of his old self. When he was ordered to assassinate Wade T., he accidentally killed the target's wife, Mercedes. In the end, Wade T. ran away to eventually become the voodoo mercenary T-Ray while Wade W. kept the name "Wade T. Wilson" and never changed it out of respect for his namesake's wife. When he was diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer, he volunteered for a subset of the Weapon-X program that was attempting to imbue a normal human with Wolverine’s healing factor.Since he is Wade T. Wilson, he has Canadian citizenship, allowing him entry into the Weapon X program. The procedure was a success, but Deadpool, who took his name from the pool that the officers and scientists bet in as to who would die next in the experimentation, became severely mentally unbalanced as a result of it. He escaped the facility and has been wandering ever since. Some people might speculate that before his name was Wade Winston Wilson his name was Jack though this isn't confirmed.</hero:origin>

  <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://whosyourhero.com/heroes.owl#Story"/>
  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">As a child, she was trained by not just David Cain, but Bronze Tiger, Merlyn the archer, and Alpha, among many others. Cain kept her trained and focused on fighting, by never teaching her speech or reading. The parts of her brain normally used for speech were trained so she could read other people's movements and body language and predict , with uncanny accuracy, their next move. This also caused her brain to develop learning functions different from most, in a form of dyslexia that hampered her ability to read and write for years to come. Training her in a variety of secluded locations Cain recorded many of their sessions.When Cassandra was 5, Cain began taking her along on his hits so she could be cultured to accept death and killing as normal. At age 8 he decided she had progressed far enough to test her abilities in the real world of an assassin. He took her to a hit where she would hand out the killing blow; the target Faizul, would never see it coming. At the time however despite going along with her father's wishes she had no idea what she was doing; she may have even believed it was only a game however after striking the deathblow, she "read" the target as he died and knew in intimate detail what it meant to take a life. This experience left her scarred emotionally and she ran away from her father for what he had caused her to do. Cassandra spent the next nine years homeless as a wandering, mute drifter.Cassandra spent the next nine years homeless, beating herself up mentally over what she'd done as she traveled the world. Entering Gotham City during No Man's Land, Cassandra came to be a courier for Oracle, even picking up rare delicacies like apples alongside her missions. Oracle took her on as a student and tried to teach her how to read and write. Over time Barbara began to see that Cassie had training and skill, but had been abused in some way. Cassandra became involved with the Bat Family after seeing the handiwork of her father, Cain, and realizing that he planned to kill Commissioner Gordon, she confronted him and saved the Commissioner. She was given the Batgirl costume with the blessings of both Batman and Oracle.Usually going out under the Batman's watchful eye she was finally allowed to go on a solo mission when a patrol station needed guarding against a local gang. Near the end of No Man's Land Batman noticed her death wish and forced her to make a decision between suicidal actions and self preservation. She opted for self preservation.Cassandra works as Batgirl with Oracle, and they become a team to be reckoned with. On time they were trying to solve a bombing at the diamond exchange that killed several people. Two-Face caused the bombing and took credit for it but the problem was why did six of the bodies disappear. It turned out they were being reanimated and used by a man named Malcolm Greymater (The General) in his crime-syndicate known as the Trio. The machine that brought people back didn't really work on everyone's minds leaving some complete zombies while others with slight memory loss that just got worse as their brains rotted. Good looking women were taken to a strip club where they would perform. Strong men were recruited in his own gang.Everything led them to Arcadia where she and Oracle worked with the Ghost. Two-Face also went to Arcadia on a separate issue of revenge against the General as well. Everything ends with Two-Face and the General killing most of their own men and the base for the General is destroyed as well with him getting away talking about moving to Metropolis and setting up again.Cassie's desire for a family grows ever stronger as she continues to live with Oracle and watches the dynamics of the Bat Family. Information on her childhood continues to be gathered as she studies her father and his movements, suspicions of her mother's true identity begin to come to light and she decides against Batman's wishes to chase down Lady Shiva and confront her about her true parentage. Having faced Shiva once before the woman had hinted at her role in the child's upbringing trying to get the girl to fight her as Cassie's new training in speech and her telepathy had thrown her off balance, Cassandra barely defeated her with a cheap shot. Later, Cassandra then requested Shiva to retrain her to read people like her. Shiva accepted her offer, only on the condition that in one year, they would fight to the death.One year later, Cassandra and Shiva fight once more, with Shiva killing her in minutes. Shiva then restarts her heart, and learns that Cassandra had a death wish. After learning this, the two have a real fight, in which Cassandra wins.Following the trail she heads to the latest home of the League of Assassins, who were lead by Nyssa, Ra's al Ghul's daughter. While making her way into the compound, Cassie drops in upon Lady Shiva's training of the latest assassin recruits. Preparing to attack, she was stunned to see the recruits address her as: "One who is all", the one who defeated Shiva in combat. After Shiva explains why she is in league with The League of Assassins, she attacks Cassie. While Cassie tried to get Shiva to answer if she was her mother, the duel was interrupted when Mr. Freeze appeared and froze Cassie. Somehow, Cassie convinced Mr. Freeze to let her go in exchange, she would help him revive his wife, Nora. When Freeze put his wife into the Lazarus pit, not only did it make her crazy, but it gave her powers to reanimate the dead and called herself Lazara. Cassie convinces Freeze to refreeze his wife by destroying the base of the Assassins with a freeze device. As Cassie made her way out, Shiva tells the students to pick their side, half go to Shiva half to Cassie. A fight breaks out and Cassie is attacked by her brother Mad dog. Mad Dog kills Cassandra, Shiva takes Cassie's body and walked away from the training session.Taking Cassie down to the Lazarus pit , Shiva threw her in and waited for the girl to be reborn. Shiva told Cassie the story of her birth while the women fought, finally getting the battle she wanted Shiva continued to tell the story as Cassie fought back, telling of Cain's use of her, of how he killed her sister to get a rise out of her. That finally he did Shiva a favor as she was stronger and better than ever, that Cassie could be so as well. Finally, Cassie was able to defeat her once again, stabbing her through a chained hook leaving her to die above the Lazarus pit. Cassie, realizing who she was raised to be, handed the cowl back to Batman and quit being Batgirl.Robin goes to track down Cassandra after she disappeared from the Bat family and found her to be the new leader of the League of Assassins. Believing her to have been captured Tim had bought along the body of David Cain as ransom. Cassandra was found to have been injected with a serum by Deathstroke that clouded her mind and judgment and forced her to obey his will. Robin tried to talk Cassandra down and offered his support to take her home, handing him a gun Cassie tells Robin to join her and kill her father to prove his worthiness an ordeal to which Robin refused. Cassie then, takes the gun and kills Cain herself, while he tells Robin that there are more girls like Cassie. A fight breaks out between Robin and Cassie until an explosion breaks out and Cassie and Cain disappear.It was later revealed that Cain and Deathstroke had set the whole thing up, hoping to work with Cassandra to create a new breed of Assassins. Using a new drug that would turn the girls into metahumans. Cassandra later turns up as a member of Titans East still under the control of Deathstroke. A strong member she works with him to try to take down the Titans, while under his control via the serum he has injected into her body. During her time there she faces Ravager Deathstroke's daughter and battles her, Robin steps in during the fight and injects Cassie with a counter serum. Her desire to kill Deathstroke and Cain begins as she sees what they have done to other girls like her and Rose.</hero:storyDescription>

Bruce Wayne mentions that no body has been recovered, and this may indicate she is not dead. The disheartened Councilman responds "if Harvey Dent has her, she may wish she were."Wayne instinctively assumes Barbara Gordon may be planning a mission to apprehend Dent, and specifically warns her not to. He claims that Two-Face is Batman's responsibility, and adds that if Batman needs help, he'll call.Gordon, ignoring Wayne's order, plans a trip to investigate St. Mary's Hospital in Arcadia. Meanwhile, Ghost is investigating the disappearance of a young woman named Debbie Scoggins. Both she and Batgirl end up meeting for the first time at an underground nightclub. Although they are unable to communicate verbally, the two quickly realize their agendas are compatible.With the assistance of Oracle and Batgirl, Ghost comes face to face with Malcolm Greymatter, the mastermind behind the disappearances of numerous woman in Gotham and Arcadia. While Ghost believed Greymatter faked their deaths in order to sell them into servitude, he reveals their deaths were real and that he was responsible for reanimating their bodies through the use of his "resurrection machine".Two-Face seeks revenge on Greymatter for reanimating the corpses of henchmen he has killed himself, claiming them as property. The conflict is cut short as Ghost and Batgirl wreak havoc on Greymatter's heart of operations. Facing defeat, he destroys the base of operations with a bomb, leaving no evidence of the reanimated bodies or the resurrection machine.

There was nothing any of them could say or do to help her to move on, Cassie had been a victim, used and abused, and for that she needed them to pay, needed to finish her father to allow herself to move on. Finding the name of a doctor who had worked on the experiments of Cain and Wilson, Cassie broke into the Batcave and hacked her way into the bat computer, with Oracle watching and intervening. Cassandra pleaded with Oracle for support and understanding, Oracle her heart understanding the girls need for redemption helped her by removing all trace of her hunt through the computer.Cassandra continued to hunt for her father, trailing the streets she followed the trail only to find a woman killing several girls strapped to a massive roundabout table.

Cassie begged the woman to hear her out and trust her but to no avail, the woman disappeared and left Cassie with a blood sample to test. Taking the test back to the cave Batgirl was confronted by Nightwing who had tracked her down through the use of the bat computer and had a hunch that she was seeking vengeance against her father. With his hunch being correct all along, Nightwing confronted Cassie and the two began to fight. They were interrupted however by the arrival of Batman and Robin, and Cassie fled from the scene. Knowing, if she had not they would try to stop her, the thought made her realize she would kill them if they did.Tracking down Marque she managed to convince the woman to team up with her and for them to work together to find Cain, but with the promise that no one would be killed other than Cain himself.

Bruce Wayne has her take down a neo-heroin smuggling operation.Blackbat travelled to Paris following a homing signal to Red Robin to the final site in a tournament of assassins, saving him from being raped by Daughter of Acheron, Ra's Al-Ghul's half sister, and defeated the vigilante Promise while freeing Drake. Cassandra then proceeded to take a sword and impale Tim in the chest, triggering confirmation that she had won the tournament, being only the eight in history to do so, and activating a system that would 'immortalize' her, by killing her with a laser. Red Robin saved her from the beam, and the two revealed they had faked Red Robin's death, using a trick sword, blood packets, and a stopped heart to fool the temple's automated systems. They attempted to examine the base, but although Tim conversed with the assassin tournament's creator, a previously unknown centuries old immortal, the base self destructed before they could learn any close as to his location.Red Robin came to Hong Kong to assist Black Bat in Cassandra's hunt for Cricket, but Red Robin and Black Bat were defeated by the superhumanly fast assassin, badly injuring Tim including having an arm and several ribs broken, and Cricket promised to fight Cassandra 'For real' next time.Black Bat returned to Gotham to aid Dick Grayson in his hunt for The Architect. Alongside Tim Drake and Damian Wayne, she played a major role in solving the case, and in a conversation with Tim, expressed an interest in stopping by Gotham more.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Cassandra first appears after the Joker's endgame, after Batman loses his memories. She arrives in Gotham to deliver a message to Dick Grayson from Batman. The message was for Dick to investigate a list of names affiliated with a secret criminal organisation led by a figure known only as Mother. Bruce intended for Cassandra to gather up his former Robins take down Mother and all those working for her. When an agent of Mother, codename Orphan, attacks Harper Row in her apartment, Cassandra arrives and helps drive Orphan away. She then heads off to find the Red Hood, another potential target of Mother. However, he believes she is the one after him and tries kill her, but Dick arrives to stop the fight before things escalate.Once the Robins and their friends are gathered, they begin investigating Bruce's message, but Cassandra and sneaks off with Harper. However, they are attacked by Orphan again. When Harper is wounded, Cassandra intervenes and drives him away yet again. Later, Dick arrives in the Batplane and takes them with him to Prague to start tracking down Mother. Once they arrive and set up shop, Dick instructs Cassandra and Harper to investigate someone on Mother's list: Prague's Prima ballerina. While they watch the ballet, Cassandra gets enamored by the sight of dancing, and almost doesn't notice when the dancers try to kill them. The two of them fend off the dancers until Dick arrives to help finish them off, but before they can leave, Cassandra runs off on her own.It is revealed that Cassandra went back to Mother's base of operations to stop her from killing all of the children under her control. as she travels trough her old home, she remembers her own story. Her father David a.k.a Orphan raised her is secret inside Mother's base. Rather than teach her how to read and speak, he taught her to read body language to hone her into the ultimate fighter. Whenever she tried to sneak out to be with other people, he would lock her in a pitch black, soundproof box for long periods of time as punishment. When she grew up, David presented her to Mother, but she was only upset that David kept a secret from her. Eventually, she decided to take a better path and escaped Mother's base. Wanting to see Mother taken down, she traveled to Gotham and informed Batman that Mother, who he thought was dead, was still active. Preoccupied with the Joker's attack, he asks her to deliver a thumb drive with everything he knows about Mother to Dick should he fall fighting the Joker. He then tells her that despite the terrible things she's done in the past, he is glad she chose to be more than what everyone wanted her to be. He then hugs her and leaves.In the present, Orphan catches her and shows her a hole filled with the bodies of Mother's children. Cassandra escapes and prepares face her father, but Dick and Harper arrive and knock him out. While they prepare to leave, Mother appears on a hologram and informs them that she rigged the base with a nuclear bomb to take hem all out. While Dick fights a recovered David, Cassandra takes Harper to the base's control room and covers her while she tried to shut down the bomb's countdown timer. When that fails, the two are surrounded by defense drones, but they all deactivate before they can kill the two. Dick found the shutdown controls after defeating David, and the three take him and escape in the Batplane just before the base explodes.The group then head's to Spyral's HQ to interrogate Orphan and figure out Mother's plan. While Spyral and the Robins try to come up a strategy, Mother uses Spyral's own technology to implement her plan: brainwash every child and teenager on Earth and force them to kill every adult. This include Cassandra and Red Robin, who begin attacking Dick and Helena Bertenelli. However, Tim told them that Scarecrow's Fear Gas could neutralize the brainwashing. Once the two teen s regain their senses, Dick takes Cassandra and they leave to find Harper and stop the brainwashed students around them. When they find Harper, Cassandra puts a fear gas mask on her. While she is no longer under Mother's control she tries to kill Cassandra anyway because she learned from Orphan that Cassandra was the one who murdered her Mother years ago. Out of options, Cassandra forces herself to fight her best friend. Hoowever, she holds back allowing Harper to gain the upper hand. Before she can kill her, Red Hood saves her, but the fear gas causes her to see Jason as her father, driving her to use Harper's taser gun on him. However, the floor is covered in water, so all three of them are shocked.Cassandra is later seen with Harper, the two of them having been captured by Orphan. As they are fly to Mother's base in Antarctica, she tries to convey an apology to Harper, but she is not interested in a apology. While she understands and is no longer angry with her, she cannot yet bring herself to forgive her. When they reach Mother's base, David presents Cassandra and Harper to her. Though she is pleased, she kills him and drops him out of the base. She then unveils a new group of Orphans, and activates her brainwashing program across the world, and have the two knocked out. When Harper recovers, Mother offers her a chance to join her. She then shows her Cassandra, completely immobilized and at her mercy. She instructs Harper to kill Cassandra and join her. Before Harper can move, the Robins and heir allies stop Mother's brainwashing program and Dick arrives to finish her. Both Mother and Dick try to get Harper to do what they think is right, but Cassandra, deciding to make things right, tells Harper to kill her. Having made her choice, Harper frees Cassandra and attacks Mother. However, Mother draws her hidden gun and fires, but Cassandra takes the bullet for her. As the remaining Robins their allies, and more Orphans arrive, Harper forgives Cassandra and helps her to her feet. Alongside Spoiler, they charge into the melee.As Mother and her Orphans are defeated, she decides to kill everyone by triggering the base's self destruct, which involves activating the dormant volcano the base is built on. Before she can escape, Cassandra leaps in to stop her. She easily best Mother, but instead of killing her like everyone thought she would, she vows never to take another life and leaves her alive. However, her father, who survived Mother's betrayal, stabs Mother and pins her in place as the base falls into the lava. Having seen the error of his ways, he apologizes for being a terrible father and falls into the lave with Mother. Everyone escapes alive, and Harper and Spoiler accept her as a friend.A month after Mother's death, Bruce has regained his memories and resumed being Batman. After talking with Harper about everything she learned, he instructs Cassandra to come out of hiding as Harper leaves. Batman tells her that even though she will have to live with killing Harper's mother, she can take another path. He asks her to leave the life behind, but she refuses to stay and help him in his fight as the new Orphan.</hero:storyDescription>

After enlisting Batwoman to help lead his new team, they begin gathering the recruits. Deciding on their second recruit, they find Orphan taking down a group of sex traffickers. After she dispatches them, Batman calls out for her to come with him. She and the other recruits arrive atop GCPD Headquarters and the two explain their plan to train them.During one of their first training sessions, the team is forced a fight a simulated army of Jokers. When Spoiler gets overwhelmed, an already fatigued Cassandra rescues her. When Red Robin shuts down the simulation against Batwoman's orders, she calls everyone out on their flawed performances. Cassandra's flaw was that she divided her attention. As the best fighter present, she focused too much on fighting for everyone. After they break for the night, Cassandra decides to drop by Stephanie and Tim's apartment, but when she sees the two are talking, she heads off to find someone to fight.Later, after Batman is captured by the Colony, Batwoman and Red Robin summon the team Cassandra is the last to arrive, but before she can go inside the Belfry, she notices jets overhead and realizes something is amiss. When Colony soldiers drop onto the roof of the Belfry and demand her surrender, she merely says "no" and charges into battle. When another contingient breaches the base, she follows them in after dispatching the first group. She tries to fight them off but they shoot her with tranquilizer darts to keep her down. She recovers as the teams uses the Belfry's escape hatch to reqroup and come up with a plan. Once Orphan confirms they are not being followed, the group head over to the Bat-Train Tim designed for fast exits. Cassandra is also present when they storm the Colony's base to free Batman. She is tasked with clearing their escape route of soldiers. By the time the others reach her, she has taken them all down, enabling them to escape.When they return to the Belfry, they discover from Tim that the Colony is trying to purge members of the League of Shadows from Gotham at the cost of several hundred innocent lives. Wanting to save as many people as possible, the team splits up to cover more ground. Cassandra is seen clearing out a shelter, unaware that member of the Shadows walked right past her. She is not seen again during the evacuation attempt.</hero:storyDescription>

Because she sees everything in this way, she can assess the weaknesses she sees and determine how best to beat or kill a target in a matter of seconds. Combined with her ability to read body language, Cassandra can both determine a target's actions and calculate the best counterattack, making her more dangerous. This ability is a double-edged sword, though, as Cassandra is always aware of which weaknesses will kill her target and which won't. Because of her vow against killing, she constantly battles the impulse to kill her enemies outright. However, because she is always aware of the ways to kill her opponents, she has to willingly ignore those options and attack in a non-lethal fashion. This nature of holding back makes her think and act below her full capabilities, which hinders her when facing opponents on her level, such as her mother.</hero:powerDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> An unusual example. Cassandra is in fact extremely skilled, but in her Batgirl solo she fails constantly due to a combination of inexperience, her own personal flaws, and most of all bad luck and circumstances outside of her control. One of the main themes of the book is that even someone with her extreme level of skill simply cannot save everyone, but her guilt complex keeps her from internalizing that lesson for a long time, leading to constant emotional turmoil on her part as she fails to live up to her own impossible standards.</hero:tropeDescription>

It's been handwaved that his cancer and healing factor fight it out, thus his appearance is always in flux. Deadpool's costume details change with the artist, such as the size and shape of the black patches over his eyes, whether his mask is completely fitted or has a little tuft/flap/thingy on the back, having Painted-On Pants or more plausible materials, the kind of gloves and boots he has, and the number and specific types of weapons he carries.

Both Cable and Deadpool are well aware of their Life Partner status, especially evidenced when they both regularly called the time during a small falling out between them ("Small falling out" in this case being Deadpool's new membership in a mercenary group hired to destabilize Cable's fictional country Providence. Said membership was revealed when 'Pool shot Cable in the back of the head.) a "divorce". Despite their split, the two have a secret pact no one else has been clued in on; they will protect each other's loved ones if the other dies by destroying the deceased's safe houses. Once when asked about his relationship with Cable by well-known gun-for-hire The Cat, Deadpool responded that it was a 'Don't ask/Don't tell deal'. Feel free to interpret that however, you wish.

Batman explained that she can read the Joker's body language but to her "It's just gibberish".) Also, because she's reading body language, she obviously relies heavily on her eyes. While Cassandra can fight blind folded and detect movement with her other senses, taking away her sight or being unable to see her opponent greatly hinders her effectiveness as it would be the same as putting heavy ear muffs (While some words may get through, the dialogue is terribly muffled and some words may be missed).

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool, the fourth-wall breaking Wild Card to end all wild cards, has his speech bubbles and thought rectangles shaded yellow, to show that he's the one guy in the entire comicverse who knows he's in the comicverse and is perfectly okay with it. On the rare occasions where his speech bubbles go to the normal white shading, meaning he's taking things seriously, you know it's significant. The plot of Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe involves the yellow and white voices getting somehow killed... and the red voice replacing it. Let's just say it doesn't go well for the world. Also anytime you don't see the yellow and white voice boxes, and Deadpool is acting calm, you're going to die horribly, because you did something even Deadpool thinks is monstrous, and he's doing this job pro bono.</hero:tropeDescription>

Even though her upbringing was a neverending training from hell, she did love her father, and yet she ran away from him. The reason was that her first kill was the very first time she had witnessed death up close and due to her body-reading abilities, she thought it to be very, very, scary. Thus she found out her upbringing was evil. Now enter the last issue of Adam Beechen's miniseries about her where it is revealed that she hated her dad all along, and that she had actually witnessed her father committing murder up close many times before her first kill. Her post-Flashpoint origin changes up a number of things</hero:tropeDescription>
  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool was retroactively added to the Weapon X program; he is not present in Weapon X stories published before his first appearance. In issue #34 of Vol. 3, Deadpool's Arch-Enemy T-Ray reveals that Deadpool is not actually Wade Wilson, but stole the identity from the man who would become T-Ray. T-Ray claims the "real" Wade was a teacher, unlike the monstrous mercenary "Jack" who became Deadpool. This clashed with Deadpool's previous Weapon X origin written by the same writer. A different writer in same series retconned the retcon with a ham-handed explanation that T-Ray was tricking Deadpool to mess with his head; the Weapon X story and the name Wade Wilson became his origin again. Most fans didn't even remember this mess until T-Ray's version was restated as false in Cable &amp; Deadpool, written by Deadpool co-creator Fabian Nicieza. Deadpool was added to Secret Wars with his own miniseries, Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars.</hero:tropeDescription>

He kidnapped the X-Men and Spider-Man and threw them on an island to hunt them down for a game-show. However, Deadpool was defeated and is last seen on the island holding his mask while the X-men fly away.</hero:alternateVersions>

Later, zombie Deadpool is the first to be sent into the 616 universe and infects some of the members of the Florida initiative as part of an invasion plan, but is decapitated and his still living head is brought back for study at A.R.M.O.R. headquarters. He tagged along Simon Garth until he sailed to the Savage Land where he meets his 616 counterpart. This Deadpool seems almost identical to earth 616's. He is sarcastic, states he had a healing factor before getting infected but it doesn't work anymore, and has 616 Deadpool's sadistic sense of humor. He also breaks the fourth wall just like Earth 616 Deadpool does. This version of Deadpool is now a member of the Deadpool Corps. headpool has also been in shorts made by a low youtuber who made a perfect deadpool costume.</hero:alternateVersions>

Freddy is enlisted by his uncle in World War 1. In order to get out of service, Freddy smokes too much and tries to pretend to have mustard gas poisoning, but his plan fails and he damages his lungs. Forced to wear a breathing apparatus, he lived the next decade losing his mind in isolation and poverty, and spent much of his time watching cartoons at the theater. During World War 2, he's convinced by Nazis to become a German super soldier and is given increased physical abilities and rapid healing as well as increased resilience to wounds due to his scabbed and callous skin - he's dubbed "Weapon Swastika." He's then sent to steal Captain America's would-be shield during the forging process, but decides that he's not a traitor and goes rogue. This Deadpool also breaks the 4th wall, but sees the world as a cartoon and has knowledge of future lingo and trends.</hero:alternateVersions>

The Watcher claims that Psycho Man's plan succeeds in other universes and he uses an army of brain-washed heroes and villains to take over the world. But, something even worse happens in this particular universe. Psycho Man fails to overtake DP. And, although Psycho Man is murdered by DP (along with the rest of the employees and patients of the psychiatric institute), his attempt at mind control unlocks a new inner-voice. This voice continues to insist that DP kill the entirety of the Marvel Universe, to spare them from the misery they're put through for the entertainment of readers. Deadpool succeeds, continuously, breaking the fourth wall saying that this is what the readers wanted. Some of the notable scenes of the book are when Wade kills the Fantastic Four, Hulk, the Punisher, Taskmaster, Wolverine and the Watcher himself.At the end of the series, Man-Thing sacrifices himself as a portal to the comic book writer's dimension where he intends to follow through in killing not only his own Marvel Universe, but all of the Universes in existence.

  <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool's primary ability is an extremely accelerated healing factor, derived from the mutant Wolverine and given to him by Weapon X. It allows him to regenerate bodily tissue at extreme, superhuman rates, and increases his longevity, giving him near-immortality. Unlike Wolverine's, however, his is driven to a certain extent by willpower, which provides an advantage in certain situations. He has regenerated from being ripped apart by a grenade, having been decapitated by the Punisher, and can survive in extreme conditions and sustain other severe injuries with no lasting damaged. Once when his body was destroyed, he was able to regenerate from his remaining hand. Foreign chemical/disease resistance</hero:powerDescription>

Shen Kuei once used enough poison to "kill 25 elephants" to knock out Deadpool for "about an hour", highlighting his resistance. This also ensures that it is extremely difficult (but not impossible) for Wade to become intoxicated.</hero:powerDescription>

  <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Like She-Hulk, Deadpool is one of the few characters known for breaking the fourth wall. This trend started in the late '90s when it was made popular by Joe Kelly. Deadpool breaks the fourth wall by talking about his own comic (sometimes even having copies of it somehow), referring to artists or writers or even the reader, and discussing comics in general. He is most known for, however, talking to the yellow narration bubbles that his comic has. There have been several theories as to what the boxes really are but no one other than Deadpool can see them in continuity and therefore many people in the Marvel Universe think Deadpool is crazy. Deadpool also references popular media culture in the comics such as video games, celebrities, social networking, and what's going on with the real world at the time.</hero:powerDescription>

In Ultimate Alliance 2, Deadpool weaponizes his own health bar to beat an opponent with it. Deadpool also posesses knowledge that only a comic book reader could know, such as mentioning Mephisto erasing Spider-Man's unmasking from existance, or remembering which comic issue a character last appeared in.</hero:powerDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool has T-Ray, Ajax, Dr. Killbrew, Black Swan, and Madcap. T-Ray, whom Deadpool calls the "the-loathe-of-my-life," isn't just a fellow mercenary and jealous jerkass out to kill Deadpool as a professional rival. T-Ray targets Deadpool's supporting characters, enlists Typhoid Mary who bed tricks Deadpool, publicly kicks Deadpool's ass after he's traumatized by Typhoid, plays vicious headgames, and in the Twist Ending to Joe Kelly's run claims to be the real Wade Wilson. And he wears a stupid bandage on his nose. In Deadpool's backstory, Dr. Killebrew used Wade as a human test subject with the sadistic assistance of his strongarm Francis Fanny aka Ajax film In the first Deadpool film, he and Dr. Killebrew became the composite character renamed Francis Freeman aka Ajax. Wade was Driven to Suicide by the unending medical torture and fell in love with Death herself, but his repeated attempts to "join" her were thwarted to keep him alive for more experiments. Then Wade realized he could provoke "Francis" into killing him. It worked too well; Ajax murdered other patients to torment Wade, then ripped out Wade's heart. Wade's desire for vengeance kept him from Death's embrace; his heart regenerated, but his sanity was broken. Wade became "Deadpool" and seemingly killed Ajax. In Kelly's Deadpool run, Ajax resurfaces and kills Deadpool— but Deadpool has Purpose-Driven Immortality to kill Ajax. Wade's old murdered friends believe Deadpool's vendetta is their Unfinished Business, and they goad him into dropping his ongoing non-murdering hero attempts so he'll fulfill his destiny and kill Ajax. Years later, Francis comes back again when Thanos and Deadpool clash over Death. Madcap and Deadpool are both unstable pranksters with regenerative powers. However, Madcap's even crazier and has a much better healing factor than Wade. Madcap's mind accidentally gets fused into Deadpool's after Thor lightning-zaps them into ashes (It Makes Sense in Context). Unbeknownst to Deadpool, the new "white caption box" voice in his mind is actually Madcap inside him. After being literally separated from Deadpool, the experience harmed Madcap in a way he never felt before. Developing a deep, personal hatred of Wade, Madcap became obsessed with completely destroying Deadpool's life and loved ones. After framing him for murders he didn't commit, very nearly killing his daughter, and several of his closest friends, Deadpool hated Madcap to an even greater extent than his past arch enemies and people like the Weapon X program and Sabertooth (who Wade believed murdered his past family). By the time Deadpool finally gets rid of Madcap, the latter doesn't mind simply because Wade himself has already managed to completely ruin his own life, with Madcap declaring the actual death he was going to give to Wade's family wholly inferior to the spiritual one Wade himself gave them.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool is known as the famous Merc with the Mouth, one of Marvel's most popular characters, with his movie franchise being even more successful than the X-Men themselves. With his massive following, merchandise, sales and surrounding culture, it might be hard to believe that when he was introduced, he was not the famous Anti-Hero we know him for, but rather a villain. Furthermore, Rob Liefeld created him as nothing more than a Captain Ersatz of Deathstroke, being a run of the mill Gun And Sword-wielding Super-Soldier mercenary who tangled with the New Mutants and had practically none of the personality we know him for now. It was when other writers like Joe Kelly began diversifying his characterization that he became as popular as he is today. Back then, no one could've expected how popular Deadpool would've ended up being, considering he's now bigger than all the New Mutants put together. Even Cable himself, who was intended from the start to be a big deal to the X-Men franchise and ended up as an even bigger deal than Liefeld ever imagined, ultimately got eclipsed by Deadpool's popularity. The 2004 Cable &amp; Deadpool series started out with Cable as the lead character and Deadpool as his sidekick, but by 2008 it was Deadpool who was the undisputed main character, and the book was cancelled in favor of a new Deadpool solo book.</hero:tropeDescription>

Hilariously, unlike the description given above, he actually is Ax-Crazy...which makes him a whole lot of fun. He also strays into Crazy Is Cool sometimes; for example, when he fights with absolutely no semblance of sense, not even deciding what an attack is going to be until it connects, to beat the Taskmaster. However, Taskmaster himself called Deadpool out for this, telling him that one of the reasons he's not taken seriously and doesn't make nearly as much money as he could is because he's so crazy that it's even more crazy for people to think they can rely on him. Hell, in some of his earliest incarnations, he would change sides in the middle of a fight if he was offered more money. If you have a hopeless suicide mission, call Deadpool. If you need subtlety and discretion, stay light-years away from him. Also, since Deadpool has developed a conscience and tries to do the right thing, there's no guarantee that he won't turn on someone who just paid him if he thinks the situation warrants it.</hero:tropeDescription>

After his character development, Deadpool lampshaded this and used it as an excuse for why he hadn't appeared in a Marvel/DC Crossover. When he finally appeared in one, guess who he encountered... In tribute to this origin, Joe Kelly (Deadpool's first ongoing writer) wrote a story where the Earth-3 Deathstroke acts like and is implied to be Deadpool. In Deathstroke's own early 90s book, a "long lost half-brother" named "Wade Le Farge" (Forge?

Remember Deadpool is ugly!* For the curious, Deadpool was happy to have an attractive face for about an hour, but eventually he became melancholic because while he had a face that people wouldn't run screaming from, it wasn't his face. He eventually came to view it as just another form of ugliness. Deadpool gets this again, in a sort of subversion. In Deadpool #64, Thanos curses him with immortality. Where's the curse in that? Well, they both love Death, so Deadpool would actually be pretty happy being killable. Torn between Cursed With Awesome and Blessed with Suck — the curse only won out because that was Thanos's original intention.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> During the first ongoing Deadpool series and in Cable &amp; Deadpool, Deadpool was a talkative loon full of bad jokes and other wackiness. However, he was also portrayed as a total psychotic with a loose, at best, grasp of sanity. All the wackiness was a cover to hide his immense mental problems and self-loathing and just the slightest nudge could send him over the edge in a violent, unsettling rage. Most subsequent writers pretty much ignore the latter part and play him up as little more than a goofy comedy character. His popularity skyrocketed after his flanderization and his flanderized version became his more iconic and well-recognized version. It helps that Marvel already has characters to fill the Canadian with Rage Issues, Regenerating Healing Powers, and a convoluted backstory complicated by Swiss-Cheese Memory, and a flamboyant joke-cracker in a red costume, whose snark covers up his inner angst roles. After Deadpool's flanderized "wacky all the time" shtick got stale with many fans, the Duggen/Posehn run achieved acclaim for its Character Rerailment.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool is known for being able to see through the fourth wall and snap it in two if he wants to. The reasoning is because he's a very special kind of insane, which occasionally allows him to perceive things others cannot. From being able to see the yellow boxes that he thinks in, to referring to the last time he showed up by issue number, Deadpool's odd observations are even occasionally plot points; for example, Deadpool is unaffected by Marvel's recent massive retcon of the past twenty years of Spider-Man's history, leaving some fans to speculate it was put there as an editorial escape plan if necessary. Fabian Nicieza usually makes a recap page that isn't in continuity, which means that blobs like the Blob can break the fourth wall at will during the recap page. One Cable &amp; Deadpool recap page had Cable hinting to Deadpool that he has infected Deadpool with subliminal messages. Since this recap page wasn't in continuity, Deadpool didn't know about the meeting, which didn't stop him from, in the story, saying these words</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool wavers between being a mercenary, a good guy, or doing merc work for the bad guy of the week. In recent years, Deadpool has been trying very hard to be more of a hero, especially after his long-lost daughter, Ellie, comes back into his life. This puts him at odds with his wife, Shiklah, who wants him to stay the killer she married. He has fallen off hard again by accidentally siding with Hydra in Secret Empire. The Despicable Deadpool has him ostracized for his mistakes in Secret Empire, and receiving no credit for the things he did to help rectify the situation. He thus decides to finally give up on being a hero, and return to his roots as a mercenary.</hero:tropeDescription>

Most of the heroes of the Marvel Universe can't stand working with him (Cable and Siryn being rare exceptions), and considering it's a Crapsack World where even guys like The Punisher and the Hulk are afforded some respect and trust, that's saying something.

Deadpools claims to have been married at least ten times previously in Vol. 5 #27 "The Wedding of Deadpool", although not all of these stories may be accurate since he is an Unreliable Narrator. The past wives listed include Ms. Marvel  turned out she was being controlled by an alien at the time, a sock puppet of Copycat he hallucinated was really her after he thought she died  destroyed, although the real Copycat was still alive, a stripper calling herself Genosha  killed during the wedding as a consequence of Deadpool messing with continuity, a woman whose name he forgot that he assassinated by pretending to be her groom  she actually hired him to make her suicide look like a murder, a woman named Penny  she didn't exist, she was part of a trap set by a villain, a woman named Anna  he had actually killed the real Anna and married Copycat pretending to be her and it turned out the people who married them were replaced with actors so it didn't count, a Dumb Blonde named Lurleen  divorced when it turned out she was actually Mystique, Outlaw  her super strength made sex extremely painful, so probably divorced, Domino  only pretending to be a couple for a mission but Deadpool took it like it was real, and she "divorced" him by shooting through him to get the bad guy, AIM assassin Betty Swanson  didn't count, she was unconscious and the guy doing the wedding was a savage land native shaman that he coerced, and a large alien woman named Orksa  although it didn't show it in this comic, he later divorced her so she could be with somebody who loved her more than he did, and of course, the main story of the issue is him getting married to Shiklah the Succubus  but they have since separated, with Shiklah marrying Dracula like originally intended after their marriage falls apart due to Wade's negligence. Deadpool mentions in issue 31 of volume 4, that he thinks they're still technically married, but isn't sure how it works with her -being a Succubus There are also all the women he had sex with but didn't marry,  one of which had his daughter. However, may be deconstructed since Deadpool sometimes never seems to remove his mask when he with some of his ladies. When having sex with Carmelita, he keeps his suit on. He has to leave to fight, and Carmelita wishes him luck and kisses him in case something bad happens to her. She even goes to the fight scene, wondering if Deadpool is ok. However, she'd never seen his face, and when she does, she chokes back bile and runs away in disgust. Granted, his face is only a mess due to injuries.

Earlier Deadpool books toyed with this; he didn't actually have any proof that he was in a comic book (because, let's face it, he can't perceive the reader no matter how much he tries to look outside the page) but kept up the act anyway because he believed it was true (and it was funny). This detail has since been dropped for simplicity. At one point, numerous characters tell him he is saying aloud everything that was in the yellow boxes, which leads him to suspect his "internal monologue" is broken.

His clothes being slightly tattered afterwards. He receives a very bad one from a mind-controlled Rogue in Uncanny Avengers. The damage being so great, he had to go to the hospital and walk with a cane for a bit afterwards. In most recent chapters, Preston delivers another bad one to him. Lesser than Rogue's beatdown, but makes Shiklah look sweet. She strangles him, knocks out multiple teeth, fractures his ribs &amp; sternum -with bone possibly piercing his lungs, as he gasps for breath. She then grabs him by the neck, continues to punch him into a tree. As he falls to the ground, she kicks him into the tree so hard, his spine almost wraps around it.

Like the Joker, Deadpool really is insane (a different kind of insane, though) and knows it, but he plays up and (possibly) exaggerates his insanity for tactical benefit. Also like the Joker, the fact that his personality changes regularly is part of canon. In his case, his healing factor and cancer have combined to leave his braincells constantly in flux. In some stories he's little more than an immature goofball, others he's perfectly capable of committing murders in cold blood that he doesn't even remember afterward. Of course, as a Meta Guy, Deadpool's also the first to admit that the real reason he changes is who is writing him at the moment.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> While it's not always clear that he's doing it on purpose, it's been said more than once that one of Deadpool's "superpowers" is actually the ability to distract and confuse people by rambling on and on about stupid things until you either want to surrender or commit suicide from all the inanity — and yet, the whole time he's rambling, he's efficiently killing or otherwise getting on with whatever task is at hand. Often people underestimate him as a complete idiot because of all the talking, although occasionally someone will say he's an idiot but not underestimate his fighting abilities. For example, his irritating, non-sequitur monologuing and erratic behavior is exactly why he could beat the crap out of The Taskmaster. Not only because Taskmaster became so irritated by the constant flood of inanity that he got all distracted, but also because he couldn't copy Deadpool's unpredictability and insanity. And Deadpool knew precisely what he was doing by unleashing it in spades. But yeah, mostly he's just nuts. During Civil War, he used the phrase "addled moron that I am (or pretend to be)". This being Deadpool, it's entirely possible the "or" should be taken at face value, and he's genuinely too crazy to know how intelligent he is at any given moment. Deadpool also says to Cable in the Cable and Deadpool comic something along the lines of "It's fun playing the fool, but do you know when it stops being fun? When you actually start to believe it." In their first encounter, Taskmaster is detailing Deadpool's skills and abilities for a group of his students and states that Deadpool is an expert at using banter to distract his opponents.</hero:tropeDescription>

Spider-Man's alternate version is a Well-Intentioned Extremist, which annoys Spidey. Deadpool gets along famously with his alternate until he discovers that alt-Deadpool isn't Wade Wilson, it's Victor Von Doom. Alt-Wade Wilson is a Big Bad who Deadpool takes down. Bruce Banner discovers that he can't turn into the Hulk in this dimension and is overjoyed, until that gets reversed. Then alt-Hulk and Hulk duke it out. One nice example involving Deadpool has him inventing an imaginary version of himself (aka, he willed himself into having a split personality) while trapped inside a room for over 800 years (long story). Why did he do this? To have someone to play hangman with of course. His plan fails when the imaginary Deadpool turns out to be a genius and starts totally kicking Deadpool's ass in the game.</hero:tropeDescription>

In Cable &amp; Deadpool, about 75% of his skin actually looked perfectly normal, with the rest just resembling bad acne. Didn't stop people from nearly retching when they saw him on the street. This is another that goes back and forth depending on who's drawing him, since sometimes he looks alright, others he's back to his horrific look. Since his power has been described as leaving his body tissue in constant, dynamic flux, this makes sense.

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> As Deadpool features a lot of both meta-commentary and time travel, this tends to come up in his book. The best example is when he gets set into the past to Amazing Spider-Man #47, and infiltrates himself into the story, Forrest Gump style.note Deadpool vol 3 #11 All the panels and dialogue are drawn in John Romita's style, and all the characters (except Deadpool and friends) talk like Stan Lee wrote them. (Indeed, enough panels are lifted from the original work that Romita and Lee are credited as co-authors.) In case you're wondering why specifically Spider-Man, it's because Deadpool's costume bears no small resemblance to that of the ol' Webhead, meaning it was a snap to redraw Spidey as 'Pool. Deadpool vol 5 #7 (from the Duggan and Posehn run) is supposedly an inventory story from 1979, crossing Deadpool (who, of course, didn't exist at the time to write inventory stories about) into the Iron Man "Demon in a Bottle" storyline, with 70s Spidey and the Power Pack also making appearances. The art and writing style both reflect this, and it even has oversaturated Bronze Age colouring. Later issues in that run follow on from this, having Deadpool show up in what are claimed to be inventory stories from other eras, with the writing and art in the style of those periods.

Rogue readily agrees to have Ellie's back. In addition to shared moments here and there between the two that hint at deeper feelings. It finally comes to a head in chapter 22, when Rogue gives him The Big Damn Kiss. Afterwards, Deadpool tells her that she deserves better, and that she only likes him because she doesn't fully know him. Rogue kisses him again -unmoving in her feelings. She tells him that the stuff in his head is a relief after having Red Skull in her's. He notes that as the most romantic thing anyone's said to him. In the next panel we see them continuing their kissing elsewhere. invoked Word of God states that the two seem very lonely, and admits that while the majority were rooting for Rogue and Gambit, he wanted to try something new and unexpected. Chapter 23's recap classifies Rogue and Deadpool's evening previous chapter as their first date. However it doesn't last as Rogue goes back to Gambit when Kitty and Colossus are unable to go though with their wedding and Gambit proposes to her.

Then Dr. Killebrew experiments on and tortures him to the point of having visions of (and falling in love with) Death. What finally demolishes his sanity is when Killebrew orders him killed, his healing factor finally kicks in, saving his life, making his disfigurement permanent, and causing Death to reject him. Depending on the writer, he's a mix of Ax-Crazy, Deadpan Snarker, gleeful Genre Savvy, and Medium Awareness. Another issue is that the Healing Factor is connected to his cancer — he's basically an immortal living cancer.

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Since the late 2000s, Deadpool began rivaling good ol' Wolverine himself as Marvel's Poster Child with multiple simultaneous comic books of his own plus so-called guest appearances that are sometimes with characters he's never met or just for a single panel. Within one year (Fall '08–Fall '09) alone, he was granted three of his own ongoing titles (more than Iron Man and Captain America combined) and a confirmed place as a regular character in X-Force, given his first animated speaking role (Hulk vs. Wolverine), confirmed as making his first speaking television debut (Season 2 of The Super Hero Squad Show), made one of the most prominent characters of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, ... errr... "featured" in a live-action film, and later rebooted in a new timeline.  In 2010, there was a Marvel Team-Up between Deadpool and It the Living Colossus. For all that Deadpool actually did to help, it was basically an It one-shot. It seems Deadpool's role in this team-up was just to get people to buy the book. Sorry, did we say Marvel Team-Up? Our mistake — the book's called Deadpool Team-Up. Yes, Deadpool was the star of a Marvel Team-Up book — meaning Marvel editorial already considered Deadpool a flagship character. Oh, and Deadpool Team-Up started with issue 900 and counts down from there. Granted, this was a joke about the then-current release of Action Comics 900 — the series got canned after a little over a year. Similar to the Wolverine variant covers, Deadpool was for one month featured on numerous variant covers, though the series were mainly in the Marvel Universe. The covers ranged from slight alterations of the original covers to parodies of classic covers (One Amazing Spider-Man cover parodied Amazing Spider-Man Annual #21, and featured Deadpool smoozing up Mary-Jane and pushing Spidey out of the way) to at least one completely original cover. He's prominently displayed on most of the artwork for Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and shown opposite Dante in the intro. His eventual burst of popularity is lampshaded by She-Hulk in the game, who annoyedly points out to Deadpool that in the 80s and early 90s she was very popular and even shared his signature fourth-wall-breaking powers. In 2013, Deadpool got his own video game. The last line of the teaser trailer? "Suck it, Wolverine!" He's also given a prominent position on the promo◊ for the LEGO Marvel Super Heroes game, right up there with the cast of The Avengers movie, Spider-Man, and you guessed it, Wolverine. In this interview, the writer of the 2010 Ant-Man and the Wasp miniseries felt the need to specify that neither Wolverine nor Deadpool appears in it.

  <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Wade Wilson was played by Ryan Reynolds in his pre-mutated form (his mutated form was doubled mutely by Reynolds and stuntman Scott Adkins). The movie was faithful to the snarkiness and sarcasm of the character, but nothing was mentioned about his cancer nor his fourth-wall breaking. It's unknown if he was a mutant in the continuity of the film, but he displayed superhuman reflexes and skills, such as his ability to deflect bullets with his swords. He was a member of Team X, the Weapon X group of mercenaries along with Wolverine, Sabretooth, Wraith, Bolt, Agent Zero and Fred Dukes. It should be noted that in the movie, Wade Wilson does not wear the classic Deadpool outfit, but does wear a red T-shirt as a nod to his comic costume. Wade has guns here but is only seen using his katanas when in combat. Humorously, he claims that he used his katanas at his ex-girlfriend's wedding sometime before the events of the film. He is present during the mission to Africa, which is where the group first discovers adamantium. The mission ends with Wolverine leaving the group in disgust after Wade and the others inflict violence against a group of local civilians. Years later, William Stryker, the former leader of Team X, informs Wolverine that both Wade and Bolt had been murdered by Sabretooth, who has gone rogue and is now hunting down his former teammates.This turns out to be a lie, and in the film's final act, it is revealed that not only is Wade still alive, but that he has also been transformed into a superhuman killing machine known as Weapon XI. As Weapon XI, his mouth is stitched closed, all visible hair is gone, and stitch marks are still present, as he had been taken out of his procedure early to fight Wolverine. He is also infused with a variety of superpowers as a result of being given DNA injections from the various mutants Stryker had kidnapped. He is never exactly called Deadpool in the movie, however Stryker once refers to him as "the Dead Pool" in the movie. In the final battle he is able to shoot energy beams out of his eyes like Cyclops, is armed with retractable adamantium katanas from his arms, has a healing factor that heals otherwise mortal wounds in seconds, can teleport like Wraith, and is controlled technopathically through a computer by Stryker. His head is cut off by Wolverine but in a scene after the credits his charred hand is dragging itself towards the head in the rubble of the facility, whose eyes open in a conscious moan when the hand touches, hinting at the possibility of a spin-off or movie of his own.Though the pre-Weapon XI scenes were well received by fans, the film's version of Deadpool (as well as the movie itself) was highly controversial with fans, and garnered a great deal of backlash. Fans took to derisively calling the character "Barakapool" due to his resemblance to the Mortal Kombat character Baraka.</hero:mediaDescription>

  <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A solo movie starring Ryan Reynolds had been in development for years, though due to the negative reception to X-Men Origins: Wolverine, it was not related to that movie and was closer to the comics. A script was written as far back as 2010, and test footage for the movie was leaked in 2014. On September 18, 2014, Fox announced that the movie was officially in the works for a February 2016 release date.The movie additionally starred Ed Skrein as Ajax, Morena Baccarin as Vanessa, T.J. Miller as Weasel, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, Stefan Kapicic as the voice of Colossus, Gina Carano as Angel Dust and Brianna Hildebrand as newcomer to the big-screen, Negasonic Teenage Warhead. The film was directed by Tim Miller from a script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.The plot consisted mostly of a Deadpool origin story. After being diagnosed with very aggressive cancer, lovestruck mercenary, Wade Wilson, allows a clandestine criminal thinktank to do experiments on him with the promise of curing his cancer. Instead, they torture his X-gene into activating, which gives him a superhuman healing factor that is constantly working against the fast spreading cancer, causing his body and his mind to be unstable. Afraid of what his fianc' will say about his new appearance, Wade crafts the Deadpool identity to hunt down the people who took advantage of him.The film opened to positive reviews and was a massive hit at the box office.</hero:mediaDescription>

After discovering that the time-traveling warrior Cable plans to kill a mutant child named Russell Collins, Wade sets out to protect the child. In the process, he ends up forming a new team of heroes known as X-Force.In addition to the returning cast from the first film, the movie featured Josh Brolin as Cable, Zazie Beetz as Domino, Julian Dennison as Russell Collins, Jack Kesy as Black Tom Cassidy, Shioli Kutsuna as Yukio, Terry Crews as Bedlam, Lewis Tan as Shatterstar, Bill Skarsgard as Zeitgeist and Rob Delaney as Peter.</hero:mediaDescription>

  <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Deadpool is a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom 3. He retains his manic mood as well as his awareness that he's in a video game, going so far as to beat his foes with his health-bar as one of his Super Combos. When he wins a match, he will sometimes insult the player for sitting on the couch while he's out risking life and limb in battle, and if he loses he'll yell at you for "pressing the wrong buttons!" Nolan North reprises his role as the character. If the player defeats Galactus using Deadpool, it is seen that Deadpool and an accomplice known only as "The Player" are on the run from the police after Deadpool caused an explosion while trying to add more power to the DJ and the Margarita machine. Deadpool also has a a theme song in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 that reflects his personality. It is one of the only songs in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 that has lyrics.</hero:mediaDescription>
