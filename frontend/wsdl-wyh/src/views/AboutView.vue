    <b>Who's Your Hero?</b> is an ontology-based project, designed to help you find all you wish to know about your comic book heroes.
    It covers a bunch of different characteristics, but more importantly it covers specific tropes that the character went through.

    <h3>What is a trope?</h3>
    <quot>
      A trope is a storytelling device or convention, a shortcut for describing situations the storyteller can reasonably assume the audience will recognize. Tropes are the means by which a story is told by anyone who has a story to tell.
