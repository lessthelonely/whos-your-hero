  <hero:evolution rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Deadpool's debut marked a very different version of the character. He was a serious, grim, and professional assassin, with none of his personality trademarks intact. It would be in his solo book that his trademark character traits would finally emerge. These would include the dark randomness to his actions, his humorous bend, schizophrenic tendencies, his suicidal personal outlook, and his 4th wall breaking quips that would make him famous, along with his love for Mexican food. Recently, Deadpool has been trying to be a hero.Deadpool has been known for carrying a number of weapons and sometimes it is as if they appear from nowhere, this is often referred to as a 'magic satchel'. Blind Al is also a significant catalyst in Deadpool's personal development, as there is a clear love hate relationship which can vary from Blind Al being a mother-like figure to an abused hostage; sometimes within the same storyline.Starting with Daniel Way's run, to depict Deadpool's unstable sanity, creators started featuring POV shots of how cartoonish Deadpool saw the world and multiple narrative voices. He had at least three voices: Deadpool's insane inner monologue, a saner narrative voice of reason, and his own out loud voice. All three would argue with each other. Eventually, the extra narrative box would be ret-conned as rival Madcap through a flashback where both were destroyed, and Wade absorbed him during his healing process.As Deadpool's popularity increased, so did his prominence in the publishing line. In a meta twist, his popularity was included in-universe with Wade monetizing his own heroism. After earning the trust of both Wolverine and Captain America, he was recruited to X-men and Avengers adjacent teams. He started a friendship with Spider-Man and was often featured as a guest star across multiple books. After ruining his in-universe reputation during the Secret Empire event, Deadpool's appearances dropped drastically. Ever since, his on-goings have failed to catch on, but he has found a regular main character role in the Krakoa version of X-Force.</hero:evolution>
  <hero:evolution rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma Frost has transitioned from one of the X-Men's deadliest foes into a central figure on the side of the mutants. Her first era presented her as a leader in the Hellfire Club, but this ended when the manic time traveler Fitzroy appeared from the future, resulting in the deaths of many of her Hellions and putting Emma into a coma. Her involvement in the Phalanx Covenant arc led her to become co-teacher of the new Generation X team with Banshee. Later, after the end of the Generation X series, when the Sentinels devastated Genosha she gained a new power - her diamond form. Subsequent story arcs made her Cyclops' new partner and lover, and a former co-leader of the X-Men. She continues to play a prominent role in Cyclops' teams.</hero:evolution>
  <hero:evolution rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Midnighter appears to be the Wildstorm Universe's equivalent to Batman, but without the moral restraint. He is also married to Apollo and has an adopted daughter named Jenny Quantum. At the end of the DC Wide crossover Flashpoint, the mysterious figure known as Pandora explained to the Flash that the separate worlds of mainstream DC, Vertigo and Wildstorm would be folded into one, as only combined could they face the coming threat to Earth and the universe. In so doing Midnighter became a member of the regular DC continuity. Because of this most of his past seems to have been erased, Midnighter is first seen when Stormwatch members are trying to convince Apollo to join their team.</hero:evolution>

  <hero:creation rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Created by artist Rob Liefeld and writer Fabian Nicieza, Deadpool made his first appearance in The New Mutants #98 (1991). Rob Liefeld has publicly stated that he had always loved the simplicity of Spider-Man's design, and therefore designed a character with a full-head mask. Deadpool was originally a parody of DC Comics' character Deathstroke, and there are real name similarities (Deathstroke’s real name is Slade Wilson) between the two. Wade's alias "Deadpool" was taken from the fifth Dirty Harry film The Dead Pool.Another inspiration was G.I. Joe's ninja Snake-Eyes.</hero:creation>

  <hero:origin rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">David Cain trained Cassandra in isolation and kept her away from human speech, raising her on the language of motion and violence. The idea was to adapt the language centers of her brain, and train it to interpret physical movement as a language. This gifted Cassandra with superb body-reading abilities, and has made fighting her "mother tongue" so to speak. However, this upbringing has also rendered her dyslexic, and when taught to speak, with audible speech-impediments.When Cassandra was eight, Cain took her to carry out a hit in Macau. Cassandra did as her father trained and instructed her to do, and ripped out the throat of a local triad boss. Due to her body-reading ability, she was able to see how death effected the man, and was traumatized by her irreversible sin. Her father came to congratulate her, and she rejected him by delivering an emotional uppercut. Shocked, Cain did not pursue Cassandra when she fled in tears. Cassandra would then wander the Earth for the next eight years, before meeting her father once again in Gotham during No Man's Land.</hero:origin>
  <hero:origin rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Wade Wilson was born as a normal person into a highly dysfunctional family in a small town in the state of Ohio. He ran away as a teenager and bounced around the country, all the while getting military training from various sources until he decided to become a mercenary. He kept changing his identity whenever something went wrong with the mission. He moved to Canada where he met a man by the name of Wade T. Wilson. Since he was Wade W. Wilson, the name reminded him of his old self. When he was ordered to assassinate Wade T., he accidentally killed the target's wife, Mercedes. In the end, Wade T. ran away to eventually become the voodoo mercenary T-Ray while Wade W. kept the name "Wade T. Wilson" and never changed it out of respect for his namesake's wife. When he was diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer, he volunteered for a subset of the Weapon-X program that was attempting to imbue a normal human with Wolverine’s healing factor.Since he is Wade T. Wilson, he has Canadian citizenship, allowing him entry into the Weapon X program. The procedure was a success, but Deadpool, who took his name from the pool that the officers and scientists bet in as to who would die next in the experimentation, became severely mentally unbalanced as a result of it. He escaped the facility and has been wandering ever since. Some people might speculate that before his name was Wade Winston Wilson his name was Jack though this isn't confirmed.</hero:origin>

She developed her powers while under pressure from her father to succeed. Emma blackmailed her father after he got a professor who she was romantically linked with fired. Despite her father being upset, he decided she was smart and offered her to take over the family business, but Emma declined, preferring to make her fortune herself. Emma left her family and joined the radical mutant group, the Hellfire Club. After spending a stint as the “White Queen,” she later defected to the X-Men to lead the team.Frost InternationalEmma, using her telepathic powers, good looks, and charm, eventually came to be the majority stockholder in a multibillion-dollar conglomerate that would later become known as Frost International, after its CEO, Miss Emma Frost. The company specialized in the advancement of various technologies. electronics, and transportation. Frost International was so successful that Emma quickly became very rich, and was later involved in the Hellfire Club. Unfortunately, Emma decided to liquidate her company's funds in order to bankroll the mutant island of Utopia "... for the foreseeable future". The current state of her company is unknown, as of now.</hero:origin>
  <hero:origin rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">First origin: Midnighter was a member of an secret experimental academy team created by the insane former Stormwatch Weatherman, Henry Bendix. Bendix erased the team's memories when he gave them superpowers. Midnighter, alongside Apollo, Lamplight, Crow Jane, Amaze, Impetus, and Stalker, formed the ill-fated team that would be sent to their deaths by Henry Bendix on their first mission. When Midnighter and Apollo sought extraction during this mission, it was only to discover that Bendix has no intention of wasting time or resources to save them when he could so easily replace them with more "super-soldiers."Betrayed, Apollo and Midnighter managed to escape with their lives, but would spend the next six years in hiding on the streets, attempting to remain invisible to the Weatherman's ever-watchful eye from the Stormwatch headquarters orbiting the earth. During this time, both team members fought to better the world on a smaller scale, and came together as lovers. Because of their self imposed exile, both Midnighter and Apollo were ignorant of Stormwatch's battle against Henry Bendix, and of his supposed death at the hands of Jenny Sparks. Only when Jackson King, the new Weatherman, discovered them on radar and brought them in for questioning (ultimately testing their loyalties by sending them on a mission) did the pair realize they were free to live in the open again as normal human beings. All files related to whom both Midnighter and Apollo were before their introduction into the team were believed to be lost, and since neither man could remember, Jackson King instead gave them new identities with which to retire from the super-soldier business.</hero:origin>

His life ended that night, what he is today grew from that wreckage of an existence. He was experimented upon for many years before he finally escaped. It was during his escape, in which the air dent he was in fell apart that he first met Apollo.</hero:origin>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">As a child, she was trained by not just David Cain, but Bronze Tiger, Merlyn the archer, and Alpha, among many others. Cain kept her trained and focused on fighting, by never teaching her speech or reading. The parts of her brain normally used for speech were trained so she could read other people's movements and body language and predict , with uncanny accuracy, their next move. This also caused her brain to develop learning functions different from most, in a form of dyslexia that hampered her ability to read and write for years to come. Training her in a variety of secluded locations Cain recorded many of their sessions.When Cassandra was 5, Cain began taking her along on his hits so she could be cultured to accept death and killing as normal. At age 8 he decided she had progressed far enough to test her abilities in the real world of an assassin. He took her to a hit where she would hand out the killing blow; the target Faizul, would never see it coming. At the time however despite going along with her father's wishes she had no idea what she was doing; she may have even believed it was only a game however after striking the deathblow, she "read" the target as he died and knew in intimate detail what it meant to take a life. This experience left her scarred emotionally and she ran away from her father for what he had caused her to do. Cassandra spent the next nine years homeless as a wandering, mute drifter.Cassandra spent the next nine years homeless, beating herself up mentally over what she'd done as she traveled the world. Entering Gotham City during No Man's Land, Cassandra came to be a courier for Oracle, even picking up rare delicacies like apples alongside her missions. Oracle took her on as a student and tried to teach her how to read and write. Over time Barbara began to see that Cassie had training and skill, but had been abused in some way. Cassandra became involved with the Bat Family after seeing the handiwork of her father, Cain, and realizing that he planned to kill Commissioner Gordon, she confronted him and saved the Commissioner. She was given the Batgirl costume with the blessings of both Batman and Oracle.Usually going out under the Batman's watchful eye she was finally allowed to go on a solo mission when a patrol station needed guarding against a local gang. Near the end of No Man's Land Batman noticed her death wish and forced her to make a decision between suicidal actions and self preservation. She opted for self preservation.Cassandra works as Batgirl with Oracle, and they become a team to be reckoned with. On time they were trying to solve a bombing at the diamond exchange that killed several people. Two-Face caused the bombing and took credit for it but the problem was why did six of the bodies disappear. It turned out they were being reanimated and used by a man named Malcolm Greymater (The General) in his crime-syndicate known as the Trio. The machine that brought people back didn't really work on everyone's minds leaving some complete zombies while others with slight memory loss that just got worse as their brains rotted. Good looking women were taken to a strip club where they would perform. Strong men were recruited in his own gang.Everything led them to Arcadia where she and Oracle worked with the Ghost. Two-Face also went to Arcadia on a separate issue of revenge against the General as well. Everything ends with Two-Face and the General killing most of their own men and the base for the General is destroyed as well with him getting away talking about moving to Metropolis and setting up again.Cassie's desire for a family grows ever stronger as she continues to live with Oracle and watches the dynamics of the Bat Family. Information on her childhood continues to be gathered as she studies her father and his movements, suspicions of her mother's true identity begin to come to light and she decides against Batman's wishes to chase down Lady Shiva and confront her about her true parentage. Having faced Shiva once before the woman had hinted at her role in the child's upbringing trying to get the girl to fight her as Cassie's new training in speech and her telepathy had thrown her off balance, Cassandra barely defeated her with a cheap shot. Later, Cassandra then requested Shiva to retrain her to read people like her. Shiva accepted her offer, only on the condition that in one year, they would fight to the death.One year later, Cassandra and Shiva fight once more, with Shiva killing her in minutes. Shiva then restarts her heart, and learns that Cassandra had a death wish. After learning this, the two have a real fight, in which Cassandra wins.Following the trail she heads to the latest home of the League of Assassins, who were lead by Nyssa, Ra's al Ghul's daughter. While making her way into the compound, Cassie drops in upon Lady Shiva's training of the latest assassin recruits. Preparing to attack, she was stunned to see the recruits address her as: "One who is all", the one who defeated Shiva in combat. After Shiva explains why she is in league with The League of Assassins, she attacks Cassie. While Cassie tried to get Shiva to answer if she was her mother, the duel was interrupted when Mr. Freeze appeared and froze Cassie. Somehow, Cassie convinced Mr. Freeze to let her go in exchange, she would help him revive his wife, Nora. When Freeze put his wife into the Lazarus pit, not only did it make her crazy, but it gave her powers to reanimate the dead and called herself Lazara. Cassie convinces Freeze to refreeze his wife by destroying the base of the Assassins with a freeze device. As Cassie made her way out, Shiva tells the students to pick their side, half go to Shiva half to Cassie. A fight breaks out and Cassie is attacked by her brother Mad dog. Mad Dog kills Cassandra, Shiva takes Cassie's body and walked away from the training session.Taking Cassie down to the Lazarus pit , Shiva threw her in and waited for the girl to be reborn. Shiva told Cassie the story of her birth while the women fought, finally getting the battle she wanted Shiva continued to tell the story as Cassie fought back, telling of Cain's use of her, of how he killed her sister to get a rise out of her. That finally he did Shiva a favor as she was stronger and better than ever, that Cassie could be so as well. Finally, Cassie was able to defeat her once again, stabbing her through a chained hook leaving her to die above the Lazarus pit. Cassie, realizing who she was raised to be, handed the cowl back to Batman and quit being Batgirl.Robin goes to track down Cassandra after she disappeared from the Bat family and found her to be the new leader of the League of Assassins. Believing her to have been captured Tim had bought along the body of David Cain as ransom. Cassandra was found to have been injected with a serum by Deathstroke that clouded her mind and judgment and forced her to obey his will. Robin tried to talk Cassandra down and offered his support to take her home, handing him a gun Cassie tells Robin to join her and kill her father to prove his worthiness an ordeal to which Robin refused. Cassie then, takes the gun and kills Cain herself, while he tells Robin that there are more girls like Cassie. A fight breaks out between Robin and Cassie until an explosion breaks out and Cassie and Cain disappear.It was later revealed that Cain and Deathstroke had set the whole thing up, hoping to work with Cassandra to create a new breed of Assassins. Using a new drug that would turn the girls into metahumans. Cassandra later turns up as a member of Titans East still under the control of Deathstroke. A strong member she works with him to try to take down the Titans, while under his control via the serum he has injected into her body. During her time there she faces Ravager Deathstroke's daughter and battles her, Robin steps in during the fight and injects Cassie with a counter serum. Her desire to kill Deathstroke and Cain begins as she sees what they have done to other girls like her and Rose.</hero:storyDescription>

There was nothing any of them could say or do to help her to move on, Cassie had been a victim, used and abused, and for that she needed them to pay, needed to finish her father to allow herself to move on. Finding the name of a doctor who had worked on the experiments of Cain and Wilson, Cassie broke into the Batcave and hacked her way into the bat computer, with Oracle watching and intervening.

With his hunch being correct all along, Nightwing confronted Cassie and the two began to fight. They were interrupted however by the arrival of Batman and Robin, and Cassie fled from the scene.

She arrives in Gotham to deliver a message to Dick Grayson from Batman. The message was for Dick to investigate a list of names affiliated with a secret criminal organisation led by a figure known only as Mother. Bruce intended for Cassandra to gather up his former Robins take down Mother and all those working for her. When an agent of Mother, codename Orphan, attacks Harper Row in her apartment, Cassandra arrives and helps drive Orphan away. She then heads off to find the Red Hood, another potential target of Mother. However, he believes she is the one after him and tries kill her, but Dick arrives to stop the fight before things escalate.Once the Robins and their friends are gathered, they begin investigating Bruce's message, but Cassandra and sneaks off with Harper. However, they are attacked by Orphan again. When Harper is wounded, Cassandra intervenes and drives him away yet again. Later, Dick arrives in the Batplane and takes them with him to Prague to start tracking down Mother. Once they arrive and set up shop, Dick instructs Cassandra and Harper to investigate someone on Mother's list: Prague's Prima ballerina. While they watch the ballet, Cassandra gets enamored by the sight of dancing, and almost doesn't notice when the dancers try to kill them. The two of them fend off the dancers until Dick arrives to help finish them off, but before they can leave, Cassandra runs off on her own.It is revealed that Cassandra went back to Mother's base of operations to stop her from killing all of the children under her control. as she travels trough her old home, she remembers her own story. Her father David a.k.a Orphan raised her is secret inside Mother's base. Rather than teach her how to read and speak, he taught her to read body language to hone her into the ultimate fighter. Whenever she tried to sneak out to be with other people, he would lock her in a pitch black, soundproof box for long periods of time as punishment. When she grew up, David presented her to Mother, but she was only upset that David kept a secret from her. Eventually, she decided to take a better path and escaped Mother's base. Wanting to see Mother taken down, she traveled to Gotham and informed Batman that Mother, who he thought was dead, was still active. Preoccupied with the Joker's attack, he asks her to deliver a thumb drive with everything he knows about Mother to Dick should he fall fighting the Joker. He then tells her that despite the terrible things she's done in the past, he is glad she chose to be more than what everyone wanted her to be. He then hugs her and leaves.In the present, Orphan catches her and shows her a hole filled with the bodies of Mother's children. Cassandra escapes and prepares face her father, but Dick and Harper arrive and knock him out. While they prepare to leave, Mother appears on a hologram and informs them that she rigged the base with a nuclear bomb to take hem all out. While Dick fights a recovered David, Cassandra takes Harper to the base's control room and covers her while she tried to shut down the bomb's countdown timer. When that fails, the two are surrounded by defense drones, but they all deactivate before they can kill the two. Dick found the shutdown controls after defeating David, and the three take him and escape in the Batplane just before the base explodes.The group then head's to Spyral's HQ to interrogate Orphan and figure out Mother's plan. While Spyral and the Robins try to come up a strategy, Mother uses Spyral's own technology to implement her plan: brainwash every child and teenager on Earth and force them to kill every adult. This include Cassandra and Red Robin, who begin attacking Dick and Helena Bertenelli. However, Tim told them that Scarecrow's Fear Gas could neutralize the brainwashing. Once the two teen s regain their senses, Dick takes Cassandra and they leave to find Harper and stop the brainwashed students around them. When they find Harper, Cassandra puts a fear gas mask on her. While she is no longer under Mother's control she tries to kill Cassandra anyway because she learned from Orphan that Cassandra was the one who murdered her Mother years ago. Out of options, Cassandra forces herself to fight her best friend. Hoowever, she holds back allowing Harper to gain the upper hand. Before she can kill her, Red Hood saves her, but the fear gas causes her to see Jason as her father, driving her to use Harper's taser gun on him. However, the floor is covered in water, so all three of them are shocked.Cassandra is later seen with Harper, the two of them having been captured by Orphan. As they are fly to Mother's base in Antarctica, she tries to convey an apology to Harper, but she is not interested in a apology. While she understands and is no longer angry with her, she cannot yet bring herself to forgive her. When they reach Mother's base, David presents Cassandra and Harper to her. Though she is pleased, she kills him and drops him out of the base. She then unveils a new group of Orphans, and activates her brainwashing program across the world, and have the two knocked out. When Harper recovers, Mother offers her a chance to join her. She then shows her Cassandra, completely immobilized and at her mercy. She instructs Harper to kill Cassandra and join her. Before Harper can move, the Robins and heir allies stop Mother's brainwashing program and Dick arrives to finish her. Both Mother and Dick try to get Harper to do what they think is right, but Cassandra, deciding to make things right, tells Harper to kill her. Having made her choice, Harper frees Cassandra and attacks Mother. However, Mother draws her hidden gun and fires, but Cassandra takes the bullet for her. As the remaining Robins their allies, and more Orphans arrive, Harper forgives Cassandra and helps her to her feet. Alongside Spoiler, they charge into the melee.As Mother and her Orphans are defeated, she decides to kill everyone by triggering the base's self destruct, which involves activating the dormant volcano the base is built on. Before she can escape, Cassandra leaps in to stop her. She easily best Mother, but instead of killing her like everyone thought she would, she vows never to take another life and leaves her alive. However, her father, who survived Mother's betrayal, stabs Mother and pins her in place as the base falls into the lava. Having seen the error of his ways, he apologizes for being a terrible father and falls into the lave with Mother. Everyone escapes alive, and Harper and Spoiler accept her as a friend.A month after Mother's death, Bruce has regained his memories and resumed being Batman. After talking with Harper about everything she learned, he instructs Cassandra to come out of hiding as Harper leaves. Batman tells her that even though she will have to live with killing Harper's mother, she can take another path. He asks her to leave the life behind, but she refuses to stay and help him in his fight as the new Orphan.</hero:storyDescription>

Her ability to comprehend body language enables her to quickly learn new martial arts style, such as learning Escrima from a single sparring session with Oracle. After having her mind altered to think like a normal person, her ability to predict movements was lost. However, Lady Shiva retrained Cass to read body language.</hero:powerDescription>

  <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Starting in The New 52 and going forward, Cassandra has the ability to see the weaknesses in almost any person or thing she sees. Because she sees everything in this way, she can assess the weaknesses she sees and determine how best to beat or kill a target in a matter of seconds. Combined with her ability to read body language, Cassandra can both determine a target's actions and calculate the best counterattack, making her more dangerous. This ability is a double-edged sword, though, as Cassandra is always aware of which weaknesses will kill her target and which won't. Because of her vow against killing, she constantly battles the impulse to kill her enemies outright. However, because she is always aware of the ways to kill her opponents, she has to willingly ignore those options and attack in a non-lethal fashion. This nature of holding back makes her think and act below her full capabilities, which hinders her when facing opponents on her level, such as her mother.</hero:powerDescription>

Despite Deadpool's general lack of allegiances, he genuinely believes in what Cable attempts with Providence, and Deadpool was the first person Cable pictured/made psychic contact with while trying to decide whether to blow himself up. They were genetically commingled, so that "one phone call" would have happened even without intent....And Cable needed to make that contact to manipulate Deadpool into Doing The Right Thing. Both Cable and Deadpool are well aware of their Life Partner status, especially evidenced when they both regularly called the time during a small falling out between them ("Small falling out" in this case being Deadpool's new membership in a mercenary group hired to destabilize Cable's fictional country Providence. Said membership was revealed when 'Pool shot Cable in the back of the head.) a "divorce". Despite their split, the two have a secret pact no one else has been clued in on; they will protect each other's loved ones if the other dies by destroying the deceased's safe houses. Once when asked about his relationship with Cable by well-known gun-for-hire The Cat, Deadpool responded that it was a 'Don't ask/Don't tell deal'. Feel free to interpret that however, you wish.

Batman explained that she can read the Joker's body language but to her "It's just gibberish".) Also, because she's reading body language, she obviously relies heavily on her eyes. While Cassandra can fight blind folded and detect movement with her other senses, taking away her sight or being unable to see her opponent greatly hinders her effectiveness as it would be the same as putting heavy ear muffs (While some words may get through, the dialogue is terribly muffled and some words may be missed). Cassandra has a harder time predicting her opponents and may be caught off guard.</hero:tropeDescription>

Even though her upbringing was a neverending training from hell, she did love her father, and yet she ran away from him.

Thus she found out her upbringing was evil. Now enter the last issue of Adam Beechen's miniseries about her where it is revealed that she hated her dad all along, and that she had actually witnessed her father committing murder up close many times before her first kill.

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool was retroactively added to the Weapon X program; he is not present in Weapon X stories published before his first appearance.

T-Ray claims the "real" Wade was a teacher, unlike the monstrous mercenary "Jack" who became Deadpool. This clashed with Deadpool's previous Weapon X origin written by the same writer. A different writer in same series retconned the retcon with a ham-handed explanation that T-Ray was tricking Deadpool to mess with his head; the Weapon X story and the name Wade Wilson became his origin again. Most fans didn't even remember this mess until T-Ray's version was restated as false in Cable &amp; Deadpool, written by Deadpool co-creator Fabian Nicieza. Deadpool was added to Secret Wars with his own miniseries, Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars.</hero:tropeDescription>

Wolverine beings to question his decision to extend an invitation but after Deadpool single-handedly takes down several assassins he knows he made the right choice. While training however Agent Zero again tracks them down and Deadpool is apparently killed when he melts into sort of goop after Agent Zero attacks him with a corrosive weapon that has an attribute that works best against those with a healing factor.</hero:alternateVersions>

  <hero:alternateVersions rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe, Deadpool kills the Marvel Universe. The Watcher watches in horror as one of the most tasteless of worlds unfolds before him. In this universe, Deadpool is victim to a freak counselling session where Psycho Man attempts to use mind-control to force Wade into being his slave assassin. The Watcher claims that Psycho Man's plan succeeds in other universes and he uses an army of brain-washed heroes and villains to take over the world. But, something even worse happens in this particular universe. Psycho Man fails to overtake DP. And, although Psycho Man is murdered by DP (along with the rest of the employees and patients of the psychiatric institute), his attempt at mind control unlocks a new inner-voice. This voice continues to insist that DP kill the entirety of the Marvel Universe, to spare them from the misery they're put through for the entertainment of readers. Deadpool succeeds, continuously, breaking the fourth wall saying that this is what the readers wanted. Some of the notable scenes of the book are when Wade kills the Fantastic Four, Hulk, the Punisher, Taskmaster, Wolverine and the Watcher himself.At the end of the series, Man-Thing sacrifices himself as a portal to the comic book writer's dimension where he intends to follow through in killing not only his own Marvel Universe, but all of the Universes in existence. The last panel concludes with Wade standing near the bickering creators of Deadpool Kills The Marvel Universe, breaking the fourth wall with a threat (or is it a promise?) to find the reader "soon enough."</hero:alternateVersions>

  <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool's primary ability is an extremely accelerated healing factor, derived from the mutant Wolverine and given to him by Weapon X. It allows him to regenerate bodily tissue at extreme, superhuman rates, and increases his longevity, giving him near-immortality. Unlike Wolverine's, however, his is driven to a certain extent by willpower, which provides an advantage in certain situations. He has regenerated from being ripped apart by a grenade, having been decapitated by the Punisher, and can survive in extreme conditions and sustain other severe injuries with no lasting damaged. Once when his body was destroyed, he was able to regenerate from his remaining hand. Foreign chemical/disease resistance</hero:powerDescription>

  <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Like She-Hulk, Deadpool is one of the few characters known for breaking the fourth wall. This trend started in the late '90s when it was made popular by Joe Kelly. Deadpool breaks the fourth wall by talking about his own comic (sometimes even having copies of it somehow), referring to artists or writers or even the reader, and discussing comics in general. He is most known for, however, talking to the yellow narration bubbles that his comic has. There have been several theories as to what the boxes really are but no one other than Deadpool can see them in continuity and therefore many people in the Marvel Universe think Deadpool is crazy. Deadpool also references popular media culture in the comics such as video games, celebrities, social networking, and what's going on with the real world at the time.</hero:powerDescription>

In Ultimate Alliance 2, Deadpool weaponizes his own health bar to beat an opponent with it. Deadpool also posesses knowledge that only a comic book reader could know, such as mentioning Mephisto erasing Spider-Man's unmasking from existance, or remembering which comic issue a character last appeared in.</hero:powerDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool has T-Ray, Ajax, Dr. Killbrew, Black Swan, and Madcap. T-Ray, whom Deadpool calls the "the-loathe-of-my-life," isn't just a fellow mercenary and jealous jerkass out to kill Deadpool as a professional rival. T-Ray targets Deadpool's supporting characters, enlists Typhoid Mary who bed tricks Deadpool, publicly kicks Deadpool's ass after he's traumatized by Typhoid, plays vicious headgames, and in the Twist Ending to Joe Kelly's run claims to be the real Wade Wilson. And he wears a stupid bandage on his nose. In Deadpool's backstory, Dr. Killebrew used Wade as a human test subject with the sadistic assistance of his strongarm Francis Fanny aka Ajax film In the first Deadpool film, he and Dr. Killebrew became the composite character renamed Francis Freeman aka Ajax. Wade was Driven to Suicide by the unending medical torture and fell in love with Death herself, but his repeated attempts to "join" her were thwarted to keep him alive for more experiments. Then Wade realized he could provoke "Francis" into killing him. It worked too well; Ajax murdered other patients to torment Wade, then ripped out Wade's heart. Wade's desire for vengeance kept him from Death's embrace; his heart regenerated, but his sanity was broken. Wade became "Deadpool" and seemingly killed Ajax. In Kelly's Deadpool run, Ajax resurfaces and kills Deadpool— but Deadpool has Purpose-Driven Immortality to kill Ajax. Wade's old murdered friends believe Deadpool's vendetta is their Unfinished Business, and they goad him into dropping his ongoing non-murdering hero attempts so he'll fulfill his destiny and kill Ajax. Years later, Francis comes back again when Thanos and Deadpool clash over Death. Madcap and Deadpool are both unstable pranksters with regenerative powers. However, Madcap's even crazier and has a much better healing factor than Wade. Madcap's mind accidentally gets fused into Deadpool's after Thor lightning-zaps them into ashes (It Makes Sense in Context). Unbeknownst to Deadpool, the new "white caption box" voice in his mind is actually Madcap inside him. After being literally separated from Deadpool, the experience harmed Madcap in a way he never felt before. Developing a deep, personal hatred of Wade, Madcap became obsessed with completely destroying Deadpool's life and loved ones. After framing him for murders he didn't commit, very nearly killing his daughter, and several of his closest friends, Deadpool hated Madcap to an even greater extent than his past arch enemies and people like the Weapon X program and Sabertooth (who Wade believed murdered his past family). By the time Deadpool finally gets rid of Madcap, the latter doesn't mind simply because Wade himself has already managed to completely ruin his own life, with Madcap declaring the actual death he was going to give to Wade's family wholly inferior to the spiritual one Wade himself gave them.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool is known as the famous Merc with the Mouth, one of Marvel's most popular characters, with his movie franchise being even more successful than the X-Men themselves. With his massive following, merchandise, sales and surrounding culture, it might be hard to believe that when he was introduced, he was not the famous Anti-Hero we know him for, but rather a villain. Furthermore, Rob Liefeld created him as nothing more than a Captain Ersatz of Deathstroke, being a run of the mill Gun And Sword-wielding Super-Soldier mercenary who tangled with the New Mutants and had practically none of the personality we know him for now. It was when other writers like Joe Kelly began diversifying his characterization that he became as popular as he is today. Back then, no one could've expected how popular Deadpool would've ended up being, considering he's now bigger than all the New Mutants put together. Even Cable himself, who was intended from the start to be a big deal to the X-Men franchise and ended up as an even bigger deal than Liefeld ever imagined, ultimately got eclipsed by Deadpool's popularity. The 2004 Cable &amp; Deadpool series started out with Cable as the lead character and Deadpool as his sidekick, but by 2008 it was Deadpool who was the undisputed main character, and the book was cancelled in favor of a new Deadpool solo book.</hero:tropeDescription>

Hilariously, unlike the description given above, he actually is Ax-Crazy...which makes him a whole lot of fun. He also strays into Crazy Is Cool sometimes; for example, when he fights with absolutely no semblance of sense, not even deciding what an attack is going to be until it connects, to beat the Taskmaster. However, Taskmaster himself called Deadpool out for this, telling him that one of the reasons he's not taken seriously and doesn't make nearly as much money as he could is because he's so crazy that it's even more crazy for people to think they can rely on him. Hell, in some of his earliest incarnations, he would change sides in the middle of a fight if he was offered more money. If you have a hopeless suicide mission, call Deadpool. If you need subtlety and discretion, stay light-years away from him. Also, since Deadpool has developed a conscience and tries to do the right thing, there's no guarantee that he won't turn on someone who just paid him if he thinks the situation warrants it.</hero:tropeDescription>

After his character development, Deadpool lampshaded this and used it as an excuse for why he hadn't appeared in a Marvel/DC Crossover. When he finally appeared in one, guess who he encountered... In tribute to this origin, Joe Kelly (Deadpool's first ongoing writer) wrote a story where the Earth-3 Deathstroke acts like and is implied to be Deadpool. In Deathstroke's own early 90s book, a "long lost half-brother" named "Wade Le Farge" (Forge? Farce?) showed up wanting to become Deathstroke and take away everything that belonged to him in gruesomely irrational fashion.</hero:tropeDescription>

But then in 2008, as if Deadpool and his readers got kicked in the head by a retconning moose, he's Canadian-born, Canadian-bred, proud to be Canadian, is confused about historic American presidents but knows all of Canada's prime ministers, and is now included on lists of famous fictional Canadians and portrayed in live-action films by Canadian Ryan Reynolds.</hero:tropeDescription>

However, later in Generation X, she was strongly hinted to have murdered a police officer looking into her sister's death (at Emma's hands). Grant Morrison and some other writers returned her closer to her roots again, according to some it made her more interesting, but played her as a complete hedonistic Jerkass, which sat badly with those who were introduced to her through Generation X, because it put all the Character Development she had during seven years in a trash bin. Later other writers attempted to either return her to the less extreme portrayal or attempt to integrate the two. How villainous she is post-Inhumans vs. X-Men tends to vary wildly. One comic might portray her as a genocidal lunatic, and the next she'll be palling around with Iceman or flirting with Jessica Jones.</hero:tropeDescription>

Amazingly, she's been shown to reciprocate his feelings—but they can only meet during the few seconds after he dies and before his mutant power/immortal curse can call him back to life.

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> During the first ongoing Deadpool series and in Cable &amp; Deadpool, Deadpool was a talkative loon full of bad jokes and other wackiness. However, he was also portrayed as a total psychotic with a loose, at best, grasp of sanity. All the wackiness was a cover to hide his immense mental problems and self-loathing and just the slightest nudge could send him over the edge in a violent, unsettling rage. Most subsequent writers pretty much ignore the latter part and play him up as little more than a goofy comedy character. His popularity skyrocketed after his flanderization and his flanderized version became his more iconic and well-recognized version. It helps that Marvel already has characters to fill the Canadian with Rage Issues, Regenerating Healing Powers, and a convoluted backstory complicated by Swiss-Cheese Memory, and a flamboyant joke-cracker in a red costume, whose snark covers up his inner angst roles. After Deadpool's flanderized "wacky all the time" shtick got stale with many fans, the Duggen/Posehn run achieved acclaim for its Character Rerailment.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool is known for being able to see through the fourth wall and snap it in two if he wants to. The reasoning is because he's a very special kind of insane, which occasionally allows him to perceive things others cannot. From being able to see the yellow boxes that he thinks in, to referring to the last time he showed up by issue number, Deadpool's odd observations are even occasionally plot points; for example, Deadpool is unaffected by Marvel's recent massive retcon of the past twenty years of Spider-Man's history, leaving some fans to speculate it was put there as an editorial escape plan if necessary. Fabian Nicieza usually makes a recap page that isn't in continuity, which means that blobs like the Blob can break the fourth wall at will during the recap page. One Cable &amp; Deadpool recap page had Cable hinting to Deadpool that he has infected Deadpool with subliminal messages. Since this recap page wasn't in continuity, Deadpool didn't know about the meeting, which didn't stop him from, in the story, saying these words</hero:tropeDescription>

Deadpool has also jumped into a malfunctioning nuclear reactor to stop it from going nuclear.

He has noted that he couldn't come back from the silly lengths that Wolverine has managed — although he can regrow fast enough that his friend Cable would psychically make his head explode for a joke. Deadpool's blown himself up and then been dragged back to the X-Men Mansion by Colossus in a sack of body parts, complaining all the way. He's been liquefied and drunk by Cable. And he's decapitated on a fairly regular basis. During the Secret Invasion, Deadpool actually weaponized his healing factor by letting the Skrulls use it to make their next generation of Super Skrulls. We then find out that if it wasn't for Deadpool's deadly cancer constantly killing him, his healing factor would be completely out of control. The Super Skrulls keep generating more and more body mass until they explode. Deadpool's daughter Ellie has a variation. After death, her body "reboots" back into the age when her mutant ability first emerged, with her memories intact.</hero:tropeDescription>
  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Part of his package of "combat enhancements" is a high-end healing ability.

In Midnighter and Apollo he channeled the power of an angel for long enough that it should have burned out his body and killed him, as he was warned by the sorceror who bound that angel to him.

When Cable and Vanessa-as-Domino come across the real imprisoned Domino, Deadpool sneaks up behind Vanessa and stabs her in the back. Vanessa stays on the run, but Deadpool keeps tracking her down and threatening her. He's on her trail in Wolverine and refers to her as "my ex-squeeze" when fighting Wolverine.

Yet all of his love interests are extremely hot women. Deadpools claims to have been married at least ten times previously in Vol. 5 #27 "The Wedding of Deadpool", although not all of these stories may be accurate since he is an Unreliable Narrator. The past wives listed include Ms. Marvel  turned out she was being controlled by an alien at the time, a sock puppet of Copycat he hallucinated was really her after he thought she died  destroyed, although the real Copycat was still alive, a stripper calling herself Genosha  killed during the wedding as a consequence of Deadpool messing with continuity, a woman whose name he forgot that he assassinated by pretending to be her groom  she actually hired him to make her suicide look like a murder, a woman named Penny  she didn't exist, she was part of a trap set by a villain, a woman named Anna  he had actually killed the real Anna and married Copycat pretending to be her and it turned out the people who married them were replaced with actors so it didn't count, a Dumb Blonde named Lurleen  divorced when it turned out she was actually Mystique, Outlaw  her super strength made sex extremely painful, so probably divorced, Domino  only pretending to be a couple for a mission but Deadpool took it like it was real, and she "divorced" him by shooting through him to get the bad guy, AIM assassin Betty Swanson  didn't count, she was unconscious and the guy doing the wedding was a savage land native shaman that he coerced, and a large alien woman named Orksa  although it didn't show it in this comic, he later divorced her so she could be with somebody who loved her more than he did, and of course, the main story of the issue is him getting married to Shiklah the Succubus  but they have since separated, with Shiklah marrying Dracula like originally intended after their marriage falls apart due to Wade's negligence. Deadpool mentions in issue 31 of volume 4, that he thinks they're still technically married, but isn't sure how it works with her -being a Succubus There are also all the women he had sex with but didn't marry,  one of which had his daughter. However, may be deconstructed since Deadpool sometimes never seems to remove his mask when he with some of his ladies. When having sex with Carmelita, he keeps his suit on. He has to leave to fight, and Carmelita wishes him luck and kisses him in case something bad happens to her. She even goes to the fight scene, wondering if Deadpool is ok. However, she'd never seen his face, and when she does, she chokes back bile and runs away in disgust. Granted, his face is only a mess due to injuries.

Indeed, the Deadpool comics became so famous for this that the dual sublines for the comic were "The Merc with a Mouth" and "Breaking down the fourth wall one brick at a time!" Earlier Deadpool books toyed with this; he didn't actually have any proof that he was in a comic book (because, let's face it, he can't perceive the reader no matter how much he tries to look outside the page) but kept up the act anyway because he believed it was true (and it was funny). This detail has since been dropped for simplicity. At one point, numerous characters tell him he is saying aloud everything that was in the yellow boxes, which leads him to suspect his "internal monologue" is broken. No one listens or responds to what he says, because he is known to be completely insane. This gag has extended to other media including Deadpool</hero:tropeDescription>

Of course, as a Meta Guy, Deadpool's also the first to admit that the real reason he changes is who is writing him at the moment.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> While it's not always clear that he's doing it on purpose, it's been said more than once that one of Deadpool's "superpowers" is actually the ability to distract and confuse people by rambling on and on about stupid things until you either want to surrender or commit suicide from all the inanity — and yet, the whole time he's rambling, he's efficiently killing or otherwise getting on with whatever task is at hand. Often people underestimate him as a complete idiot because of all the talking, although occasionally someone will say he's an idiot but not underestimate his fighting abilities. For example, his irritating, non-sequitur monologuing and erratic behavior is exactly why he could beat the crap out of The Taskmaster. Not only because Taskmaster became so irritated by the constant flood of inanity that he got all distracted, but also because he couldn't copy Deadpool's unpredictability and insanity. And Deadpool knew precisely what he was doing by unleashing it in spades. But yeah, mostly he's just nuts. During Civil War, he used the phrase "addled moron that I am (or pretend to be)". This being Deadpool, it's entirely possible the "or" should be taken at face value, and he's genuinely too crazy to know how intelligent he is at any given moment. Deadpool also says to Cable in the Cable and Deadpool comic something along the lines of "It's fun playing the fool, but do you know when it stops being fun? When you actually start to believe it." In their first encounter, Taskmaster is detailing Deadpool's skills and abilities for a group of his students and states that Deadpool is an expert at using banter to distract his opponents.</hero:tropeDescription>

Spider-Man's alternate version is a Well-Intentioned Extremist, which annoys Spidey. Deadpool gets along famously with his alternate until he discovers that alt-Deadpool isn't Wade Wilson, it's Victor Von Doom. Alt-Wade Wilson is a Big Bad who Deadpool takes down. Bruce Banner discovers that he can't turn into the Hulk in this dimension and is overjoyed, until that gets reversed. Then alt-Hulk and Hulk duke it out. One nice example involving Deadpool has him inventing an imaginary version of himself (aka, he willed himself into having a split personality) while trapped inside a room for over 800 years (long story). Why did he do this? To have someone to play hangman with of course. His plan fails when the imaginary Deadpool turns out to be a genius and starts totally kicking Deadpool's ass in the game.</hero:tropeDescription>

After they stopped laughing, Emma offered Toad her particular house so he can recover without further humiliation. The interesting part is that this happened when Emma was White Queen and a true villainess, so sparing The Grotesque in this period truly applies for the trope.

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool's appearance was horrific when it was first seen, due to the artificial origin of his healing factor reacting with incurable cancer. Over time, it changed and simplified from "bubbles and nodules of flesh with random hair" to "flesh-coloured de-uglified Ben Grimm", and some artists go even further. In Cable &amp; Deadpool, about 75% of his skin actually looked perfectly normal, with the rest just resembling bad acne. Didn't stop people from nearly retching when they saw him on the street. This is another that goes back and forth depending on who's drawing him, since sometimes he looks alright, others he's back to his horrific look. Since his power has been described as leaving his body tissue in constant, dynamic flux, this makes sense. There was a time he was given the face of Thom Cruz, and spent most of the issue trying to get rid of it.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> As Deadpool features a lot of both meta-commentary and time travel, this tends to come up in his book. The best example is when he gets set into the past to Amazing Spider-Man #47, and infiltrates himself into the story, Forrest Gump style.note Deadpool vol 3 #11 All the panels and dialogue are drawn in John Romita's style, and all the characters (except Deadpool and friends) talk like Stan Lee wrote them. (Indeed, enough panels are lifted from the original work that Romita and Lee are credited as co-authors.) In case you're wondering why specifically Spider-Man, it's because Deadpool's costume bears no small resemblance to that of the ol' Webhead, meaning it was a snap to redraw Spidey as 'Pool. Deadpool vol 5 #7 (from the Duggan and Posehn run) is supposedly an inventory story from 1979, crossing Deadpool (who, of course, didn't exist at the time to write inventory stories about) into the Iron Man "Demon in a Bottle" storyline, with 70s Spidey and the Power Pack also making appearances. The art and writing style both reflect this, and it even has oversaturated Bronze Age colouring. Later issues in that run follow on from this, having Deadpool show up in what are claimed to be inventory stories from other eras, with the writing and art in the style of those periods. Including one from Deadpool's actual early days, with a Rob Liefeld in-joke as the characters have everything possible hiding their feet.</hero:tropeDescription>

Uncanny Avengers has Rogue and Deadpool playing this trope big time. Rogue couldn't stand him at first, but they slowly developed a genuine bond -enough so that Wade takes Rogue to see his daughter, whom he asks Rogue to watch over if she becomes a mutant. Rogue readily agrees to have Ellie's back. In addition to shared moments here and there between the two that hint at deeper feelings. It finally comes to a head in chapter 22, when Rogue gives him The Big Damn Kiss. Afterwards, Deadpool tells her that she deserves better, and that she only likes him because she doesn't fully know him. Rogue kisses him again -unmoving in her feelings. She tells him that the stuff in his head is a relief after having Red Skull in her's. He notes that as the most romantic thing anyone's said to him. In the next panel we see them continuing their kissing elsewhere. invoked Word of God states that the two seem very lonely, and admits that while the majority were rooting for Rogue and Gambit, he wanted to try something new and unexpected. Chapter 23's recap classifies Rogue and Deadpool's evening previous chapter as their first date. However it doesn't last as Rogue goes back to Gambit when Kitty and Colossus are unable to go though with their wedding and Gambit proposes to her.

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Deadpool was probably messed up before developing terminal cancer, but the Weapon X program (which initially failed to give him a Healing Factor) gives him a hard shove in that direction. Then Dr. Killebrew experiments on and tortures him to the point of having visions of (and falling in love with) Death. What finally demolishes his sanity is when Killebrew orders him killed, his healing factor finally kicks in, saving his life, making his disfigurement permanent, and causing Death to reject him. Depending on the writer, he's a mix of Ax-Crazy, Deadpan Snarker, gleeful Genre Savvy, and Medium Awareness. Another issue is that the Healing Factor is connected to his cancer — he's basically an immortal living cancer. The constant state of flux and strain this places on him (including his brain) is why he's so unstable.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Since the late 2000s, Deadpool began rivaling good ol' Wolverine himself as Marvel's Poster Child with multiple simultaneous comic books of his own plus so-called guest appearances that are sometimes with characters he's never met or just for a single panel. Within one year (Fall '08–Fall '09) alone, he was granted three of his own ongoing titles (more than Iron Man and Captain America combined) and a confirmed place as a regular character in X-Force, given his first animated speaking role (Hulk vs. Wolverine), confirmed as making his first speaking television debut (Season 2 of The Super Hero Squad Show), made one of the most prominent characters of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2, ... errr... "featured" in a live-action film, and later rebooted in a new timeline.  In 2010, there was a Marvel Team-Up between Deadpool and It the Living Colossus. For all that Deadpool actually did to help, it was basically an It one-shot. It seems Deadpool's role in this team-up was just to get people to buy the book. Sorry, did we say Marvel Team-Up? Our mistake — the book's called Deadpool Team-Up. Yes, Deadpool was the star of a Marvel Team-Up book — meaning Marvel editorial already considered Deadpool a flagship character. Oh, and Deadpool Team-Up started with issue 900 and counts down from there. Granted, this was a joke about the then-current release of Action Comics 900 — the series got canned after a little over a year. Similar to the Wolverine variant covers, Deadpool was for one month featured on numerous variant covers, though the series were mainly in the Marvel Universe. The covers ranged from slight alterations of the original covers to parodies of classic covers (One Amazing Spider-Man cover parodied Amazing Spider-Man Annual #21, and featured Deadpool smoozing up Mary-Jane and pushing Spidey out of the way) to at least one completely original cover. He's prominently displayed on most of the artwork for Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and shown opposite Dante in the intro. His eventual burst of popularity is lampshaded by She-Hulk in the game, who annoyedly points out to Deadpool that in the 80s and early 90s she was very popular and even shared his signature fourth-wall-breaking powers. In 2013, Deadpool got his own video game. The last line of the teaser trailer? "Suck it, Wolverine!" He's also given a prominent position on the promo◊ for the LEGO Marvel Super Heroes game, right up there with the cast of The Avengers movie, Spider-Man, and you guessed it, Wolverine. In this interview, the writer of the 2010 Ant-Man and the Wasp miniseries felt the need to specify that neither Wolverine nor Deadpool appears in it.

  <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Wade Wilson was played by Ryan Reynolds in his pre-mutated form (his mutated form was doubled mutely by Reynolds and stuntman Scott Adkins). The movie was faithful to the snarkiness and sarcasm of the character, but nothing was mentioned about his cancer nor his fourth-wall breaking. It's unknown if he was a mutant in the continuity of the film, but he displayed superhuman reflexes and skills, such as his ability to deflect bullets with his swords. He was a member of Team X, the Weapon X group of mercenaries along with Wolverine, Sabretooth, Wraith, Bolt, Agent Zero and Fred Dukes. It should be noted that in the movie, Wade Wilson does not wear the classic Deadpool outfit, but does wear a red T-shirt as a nod to his comic costume. Wade has guns here but is only seen using his katanas when in combat. Humorously, he claims that he used his katanas at his ex-girlfriend's wedding sometime before the events of the film. He is present during the mission to Africa, which is where the group first discovers adamantium. The mission ends with Wolverine leaving the group in disgust after Wade and the others inflict violence against a group of local civilians. Years later, William Stryker, the former leader of Team X, informs Wolverine that both Wade and Bolt had been murdered by Sabretooth, who has gone rogue and is now hunting down his former teammates.This turns out to be a lie, and in the film's final act, it is revealed that not only is Wade still alive, but that he has also been transformed into a superhuman killing machine known as Weapon XI. As Weapon XI, his mouth is stitched closed, all visible hair is gone, and stitch marks are still present, as he had been taken out of his procedure early to fight Wolverine. He is also infused with a variety of superpowers as a result of being given DNA injections from the various mutants Stryker had kidnapped. He is never exactly called Deadpool in the movie, however Stryker once refers to him as "the Dead Pool" in the movie. In the final battle he is able to shoot energy beams out of his eyes like Cyclops, is armed with retractable adamantium katanas from his arms, has a healing factor that heals otherwise mortal wounds in seconds, can teleport like Wraith, and is controlled technopathically through a computer by Stryker. His head is cut off by Wolverine but in a scene after the credits his charred hand is dragging itself towards the head in the rubble of the facility, whose eyes open in a conscious moan when the hand touches, hinting at the possibility of a spin-off or movie of his own.Though the pre-Weapon XI scenes were well received by fans, the film's version of Deadpool (as well as the movie itself) was highly controversial with fans, and garnered a great deal of backlash. Fans took to derisively calling the character "Barakapool" due to his resemblance to the Mortal Kombat character Baraka.</hero:mediaDescription>
  <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Deadpool is featured in the video game adaption of the Wolverine movie. He is the final boss fight (as Weapon XI) as he is in the film.</hero:mediaDescription>
  <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma appears briefly in this film and is played by Tahyna Tozzi. Emma is present in Wolverine's past and she is a mutant with the ability to turn her body in diamond form. She does not display telepathy. She is shown as the sister of Silver Fox and was a prisoner of William Stryker trying to free herself.(Note: It was later "revealed" that Emma of X-Men Origins: Wolverine wasn't the real Emma Frost. If there is any connection between Emma (X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and Emma Frost (X-Men: First Class) is still unknown.)</hero:mediaDescription>

  <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A solo movie starring Ryan Reynolds had been in development for years, though due to the negative reception to X-Men Origins: Wolverine, it was not related to that movie and was closer to the comics. A script was written as far back as 2010, and test footage for the movie was leaked in 2014. On September 18, 2014, Fox announced that the movie was officially in the works for a February 2016 release date.The movie additionally starred Ed Skrein as Ajax, Morena Baccarin as Vanessa, T.J. Miller as Weasel, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, Stefan Kapicic as the voice of Colossus, Gina Carano as Angel Dust and Brianna Hildebrand as newcomer to the big-screen, Negasonic Teenage Warhead. The film was directed by Tim Miller from a script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.The plot consisted mostly of a Deadpool origin story. After being diagnosed with very aggressive cancer, lovestruck mercenary, Wade Wilson, allows a clandestine criminal thinktank to do experiments on him with the promise of curing his cancer. Instead, they torture his X-gene into activating, which gives him a superhuman healing factor that is constantly working against the fast spreading cancer, causing his body and his mind to be unstable. Afraid of what his fianc' will say about his new appearance, Wade crafts the Deadpool identity to hunt down the people who took advantage of him.The film opened to positive reviews and was a massive hit at the box office.</hero:mediaDescription>

After discovering that the time-traveling warrior Cable plans to kill a mutant child named Russell Collins, Wade sets out to protect the child. In the process, he ends up forming a new team of heroes known as X-Force.In addition to the returning cast from the first film, the movie featured Josh Brolin as Cable, Zazie Beetz as Domino, Julian Dennison as Russell Collins, Jack Kesy as Black Tom Cassidy, Shioli Kutsuna as Yukio, Terry Crews as Bedlam, Lewis Tan as Shatterstar, Bill Skarsgard as Zeitgeist and Rob Delaney as Peter.</hero:mediaDescription>

Xavier and Frost became romantically involved while Xavier was still in a relationship with Mystique, causing Mystique to angrily lash out at Xavier in a grotesque form until Emma had to diamond-punch her. Emma was even responsible for the naming of Xavier's cat, saying it should be named Mystique when it destroyed his office in a similar manner to the actual Mystique. Emma and Charles, however, didn't make it as a couple. Frost leaves Xavier for mostly ideological differences as she thinks his approach to the mutant/human relation was too violent. Frost is more passive towards working on the mutant/human relation then Xavier. Frost goes back to Chicago and becomes a teacher giving mutant education seminars. The governor is very supportive of Frost's idea and helped introduce her to the White House chief of staff and eventually met the President.They come up with the New Mutants which is supposed to help educate humans about mutants while cutting ties with Xavies. During a press conference, Emma, the New Mutants, and even the President are attacked by Sentinels. Xavier and the X-Men came to help them. Xavier tried to convince Emma to come back to the school but she declined and returned to Chicago. In Chicago, she creates a new program called Academy of Tomorrow (the X-Men-like squad of the school being the Ultimate version of the New Mutants). She was later shown to be dating Shinobi Shaw (son of the deceased leader of the club, Sebastian Shaw). After Shinobi is arrested for attacking Jean Grey in order to release the Phoenix Force she was revealed to be the White Queen of this universe's Hellfire Club (wearing an outfit highly similar to her mainstream counterpart's White Queen garb) and requesting a new boyfriend. During the Ultimatum event, she is later confirmed dead by Madrox in issue #3.This version of Emma dresses more modestly and professionally than her mainstream counterpart, with even her initial outfit similar to her mainstream counterpart's White Queen costume showing very little skin. It is only when she is revealed as the White Queen that she wears the more revealing attire recognizable by her alternate counterpart. She also wore glasses most of the time (including as the White Queen).

The team investigates occurrences in New Albion (which is known as California). Emma also refused Cyclops proposals stating her desire to avoid the "tedious scandal" so it would not cause any issues between the two of them. After a misunderstanding for being blamed for the deaths of the passengers in Hindenburg Disaster, the government placed the X-Society under house arrest so Emma migrated to Europe and was married to Cyclops. She later reappeared as Emmeline Frost-Summers, having married Cyclops, in the "Exaltation" storyline in "Astonishing X-Men", when Scott Summers from Earth-616 had been kidnapped by an alternate version of Charles Xavier known as "Savior". The world that this Xavier lived in was literally breaking apart, and only the power of Scott's optic beams were able to hold it together. However the price of this was the ultimate sacrifice: death. So Savior abducted the Scott Summers of various alternate Earths sacrificing them against their will to maintain his own world. Earth-616 Scott broke Emmeline out of her prison, and along with alternate versions of Storm, Nightcrawler, and Wolverine (known as Howlett only), they attempted to stop Savior. Reinforcements soon arrived in the form of Earth-616's Emma Frost and Ororo Munroe, who fought beside their alternate Earth counterparts. Emma helped Emmeline up and the two launched a telepathic assault against Savior. Once Savior had been stopped, Emmeline and the other aforementioned members of Scott's crew decided to remain there and band together to save that Earth. Emmeline revealed that the Scott she married - the Scott of Earth-889 - had suffered the fate Savior intended. He had died holding the world together with the energy of his optic beams. This makeshift new team would later become ... the X-Treme X-Men! Kurt Waggoner of the United States of California, General Howlett of the Dominion of Canada, and Emmeline Frost-Summers of the New Albion X-Society would soon be joined by Earth-616's Alison Blaire, aka Dazzler. They would embark on a journey to save different realities. The only way they could do this was by killing the evil Charles Xaviers in each reality. In first reality they traveled to, they stumbled immediately into the Pantheon of the Gods: Namor, god of the sea, Thor, god of thunder, Sabretooth, god of the wild, Warran, god of the air and sky, Draka, god of ice and snow, and Storm, the All-Mother. Emmeline bows to the gods so as not to incur their wrath. Alison has a problem doing so. After a brief battle with the gods, Xavier and Magnus arrive to whisk the team away to their version of Utopia. Emmeline and the head of Xavier, however, remain as telepathic servants to the gods. The X-treme X-Men return along with Magnus and Xavier only to find that the Xavier they thought was good was really manipulating the gods into killing mortals. The X-treme X-Men saved and freed the gods. In return for their favor, the All-Mother Storm offered them godhood. Emmeline decided to accept the offer, and the All-Mother began the transformation process. Emmeline notes that the one thing she had that was a weakness was her heart (emotion). The process of granting her godhood had removed that one weakness, and in the process, Emmeline's flesh turned to flawless diamond. Emmeline became the Diamond Queen, goddess of perfection and the mind.</hero:alternateVersions>

She tries to forcibly recruit Kitty Pryde to the club but was opposed by the X-Men. Though Emma is initially triumphant, the X-Men eventually defeats her. She and her mutant students, the Hellions would encounter the X-Men many times after this.Emma also plotted with Sebastian Shaw to kill Selene during her time as White Queen, as Sebastian Shaw saw Selene as a threat to his power. Emma was in charge of training a young mutant with great power named Firestar, who was meant to kill Selene, but Firestar inevitably found out about Emma and Shaw's true intentions and turned on them.At some point, Emma decided that she wanted more students, and approached Erik Magnus aka Magneto to get him to transfer his students to her academy. The White Queen snuck into Magneto's office and surprised him while he was pouring himself a drink. Magneto questions her, asking her why she had come to see him, and she tells him that her intentions are not hostile, as if they were he would be dead. Magneto tells her that he will never transfer his students, so Emma used her telepathy to influence Magneto and force him to do so.Her time with the Hellfire Club ends when she is attacked by a mad time traveler named Trevor Fitzroy. In the ensuing incident which also involved the X-Men, most of the Hellions are killed, and Emma in sent into a coma. She is eventually revived, although her mind is transferred to Bobby Drake's body. Initially, Emma thought Xavier is holding her hostage, so she flees to Frost International - still in Iceman's body. Accessing one of her computers, Emma discovers her Hellions were dead and blames herself for it.When Xavier and some other X-Men finally catch up with her, Frost confesses to Charles that the only reason she fights him over young mutants was that she believes that she could offer them something Xavier can't and that their deaths prove that she was wrong.

The attack wiped out the population of the island. Jean Grey and Hank McCoy traveled to Genosha to help with relief efforts and discovered only one survivor - Emma Frost. She'd been saved by the manifestation of her secondary mutation, a flexible, organic diamond form. In her arms, she held the corpse of her former student, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, unwilling to accept that she'd died. Emma was taken back to the Xavier Institute so that Beast could run a few tests on her new mutation. He concluded that she'd been gifted with diamond skin. Unfortunately, when in diamond form, Emma discovered that she could no longer access her telepathy. In this form, she could not experience genuine emotion or pain. After telepathically summoning a taxi, Emma planned to leave the Institute, but she said she had an "epiphany", and decided to stop the car and head back to the school. She entered as the other X-Men were battling Cassandra Nova. In her diamond form, Emma twisted Nova's neck, killing her, saying that "There are just some things that shouldn't be forgiven." However, Nova had a type of healing factor that kicked in and brought her back. Unbeknownst to the X-Men, Nova had switched places with Xavier by means of a consciousness transfer.

Despite his seemingly wannabe-attitude, Emma believed he was involved in a plot far more sinister. When questioned by the pair, Sublime had his U-Men attack Emma and Scott. One of them broke Emma's nose. She shifted into diamond form, unable to telepathically shut them down because she was being blocked by the captive Martha Johansson who would go on to become No-Girl. Emma and Scott were detained. The U-Men were given orders to sever Scott's head from his body. They were to later turn their attention to Emma to take her apart and make some sort of human chandelier out of her. While they were occupied with Scott, Emma broke free of her restraints and angrily took down her opponents, freeing Scott in the process. They located Sublime once again in his office. Emma telepathically stimulated the man's pain receptors so that he could feel what she felt when her nose was broken but amplified to an unbearable degree. Emma then attacked him, slamming him into the large windows, breaking the glass when she did so. She held him several stories above the ground, threatening to drop him. Scott urged her not to, reminding her that X-Men don't kill. Sublime let go of Emma, falling to his death. Emma told Scott not to blame her as "he practically somersaulted" from her grip.Cassandra Nova had been using her influence in the Shi'ar Empire to return to Earth with a host of Shi'ar destroyers. It was revealed that she had unleashed thousands of nano sentinels into the air at the Xavier Institute, infecting the X-Men. She then lied to the Superguardians, telling them that this mutant plague was contagious and needed to be wiped out before it harmed everyone else in the galaxy. The Shi'ar Imperial Guard attacked the Institute. Emma was taken out first so that her formidable telepathic powers would not interfere with their invasion. A device was placed on her head that prevented her from using her powers. As the Superguardians battled their way into the school, Emma was stuck, powerless on the campus. Fortunately for her, the Stepford Cuckoos were able to psychically learn how to unlock the device. They helped Emma out of her constraints, and she headed back to the mansion, where an understanding between the X-Men and the Imperial Guard had been reached. Unfortunately, Cassandra Nova did not halt her attack, still using Xavier's body. All hope seemed lost until Emma returned and tricked Nova into making a deal with her. Emma would provide Nova with a host body if Nova let her live. Nova agreed and entered the body of the alien, Stuff, who was a gelatinous blob programmed for learning basic things, meaning Nova would be trapped in the body of an unintelligent, incompetent alien blob.</hero:storyDescription>

The Cuckoos were mad that under Emma's tutelage, Sophie had decided to play the hero and died for it. This was their way of getting revenge. Scott and Emma were in the middle of their psychic tryst when Jean Grey returned, and burst into Emma's thoughts, catching them in the act. Scott tries to explain, but Jean shuts him out and gets personal with Emma. She forces her way into Emma's mind, and they argue, while Jean explores the depths of Emma's psyche, looking for memories Emma has been keeping well hidden. After invading Emma's mind and stomping around in it, Jean leaves, and Emma falls into Wolverine's arms, admitting finally and lamenting that she has fallen in love with Scott Summers. Beast goes to check on her later on, only to discover, to his shock and dismay, that Emma has been shot and shattered into thousands of little diamond shards. Veteran X-Men Lucas Bishop and Sage arrive on the scene to investigate Emma Frost's murder. They lock down the school and begin questioning everyone. It is later revealed that Angel Salvadore had confronted Emma Frost and shot her in her nose (the flawed weak point of her diamond form), thereby shattering her.

Hank McCoy busied himself with reassembling Emma's diamond form in his lab as if it were a giant puzzle. When he was nearing completion, Jean decided to step in and used her Phoenix powers to piece Emma back together and fuse all the shards. Emma was alive again, and the first thing she did was shout out the name of Esme. Bishop and Sage confronted Esme as she was attempting to escape the school. She easily defeated them telepathically and then left the premises in a cab. It was revealed that Esme had been dealing the drug Kick at the school, and had gotten rid of Emma because she had been investigating it. Sooner or later, she would have discovered that Esme was behind it all. Esme had been using Kick to enhance her telepathy so that she could take total control of the hive mind she shared with the other Stepford Cuckoos. Sophie attempted to fight back, and because of that, Esme influenced Sophie's brash heroism during the riot at the school, thereby steering Sophie to her death.

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma is called upon by Norman Osborn, after he is appointed as America's "Top Cop", to join a group named the Cabal to help Osborn consolidate power. Following a series of anti-mutant protests and riots in San Francisco, Emma is tasked by Norman Osborn to lead a civil peacekeeping group of X-Men. She is given command over Wolverine's son Daken, Weapon Omega, Mimic, and the duo of Cloak and Dagger. Emma brought a final element to the team: Namor, with whom she had previously shared a romantic relationship. Emma's first fight with the team occurred when she arrests a group of mutant vandals led by her own former student, Hellion. Emma insists on touring a mutant prison to see how the prisoners are being treated. She is then contacted, weakly, by Professor Xavier, and he informs her that he and Hank are being kept prisoner there. He also tells her that the Omega Chair, developed by the Dark Beast has horrible side effects and that Osborn isn't telling her everything. Emma then verbally reassures the Professor that she believes him and that she would make sure everything would be all right.</hero:storyDescription>

Jubilee was targeted by a vampire suicide bomber and was thusly transformed into a vampire, herself. The plan was to lure Logan aka Wolverine out to track her down and save her. According to Scott's plan, Logan's healing factor was temporarily negated and he turned into a vampire as well. Emma suggested finding the deceased Dracula, and reanimating him so that he might take down Xarus for them. Namor retrieved Dracula's head and Storm and Gambit were dispatched to find the body. Once put back together, Dracula threatened to simply attack Utopia himself. Eventually, Xarus led a full-scale attack on Utopia, which was defended by the "Tough Skin" squad, led by Cyclops, Emma, and Blade, the vampire hunter. Assuming her diamond form, Emma was able to effectively battle the vampire hordes because they could not bite her or do any damage. The sheer numbers of Xarus's legion soon overwhelmed the X-Men, and as they prepared to fall back, the vampire Wolverine was sent to kill Scott. It was then that Scott's plan played out, as Logan's healing factor was restored, and he returned to normalcy. Dracula's arrival saw Emma's plan play out, as father killed son, and the X-Men were able to send the vampires back to where they came from, relatively unscathed.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When Scott Summers and Wolverine visited the United Nations to speak at an International Arms Control Conference, they were surprised to find another mutant in attendance: Quentin Quire, aka Kid Omega. Quentin used his vast psychic powers to force the world leaders in the room to reveal their deepest darkest secrets on live television. This incident sparked worldwide outrage and widespread panic. Mutant hysteria was at an all-time high as world leaders took old models of Sentinels that had been commissioned long ago out of storage. The Sentinels in nearly every country had been reactivated and were on the lookout for mutants. Emma Frost broadcast a telepathic message to every remaining mutant on the planet, warning them about the sentinels, and urging them to lay low. Emma also ran telepathic surveillance with the Stepford Cuckoos as teams were deployed into the field to destroy the sentinels. The old models began to malfunction and began attacking everyone around them - not just humans. Soon thereafter, Quentin Quire turned up on Utopia seeking sanctuary. Wolverine decided against it, but Cyclops allowed him to stay. He was sent to a room, but not without a stern warning from Emma. While most X-Men were out dealing with the Sentinel problem, Emma decided to visit the Museum of Mutant History located elsewhere in San Francisco on the night of its grand opening. The mutant-friendly Mayor Sinclair had invited Cyclops to the event. Cyclops decided to send the Sub-Mariner, Colossus, Iceman, and Magneto with Emma as a show of force to the outside world. While at the museum, Emma notes that she is mentioned barely four times, and in three of them, as a villain. Later, after taking photos, Emma and the X-Men are attacked by Kade Kilgore, his Inner Circle, and their henchmen. Emma's telepathy is blocked by a device activated by Maximilian Frankenstein of Kilgore's Inner Circle. He reveals there is a tiny button hidden away in his glove by his pinkie finger that allowed him to block her powers. Emma simply breaks his finger, reactivating her telepathic powers. Before she has the ability to shut down the invaders, a space slug is attached to her face, incapacitating Emma and the others. With the 'heavy hitters' down, Idie Okonkwo aka Oya, decides, based on Cyclops's orders, to attack the intruders. She burns them alive, all except for Kilgore and his Inner Circle, who escape. This attack sets Wolverine off against Cyclops, saying that it wasn't right for Oya to do what she did. Wolverine blamed Scott, and Scott accepted the blame. By the time the slug was removed from Emma's face, Cyclops and Wolverine had taken down a mega-sentinel that attacked Utopia - with the help of the mutant children.This final battle was what made up Logan's mind. He decided to leave Utopia saying that Cyclops was turning children into soldiers. Scott and Logan invited the rest of the mutants to make up their mind, and choose a side, and reassured them that there would be no hard feelings. Cyclops naturally assumed that Emma would stay on Utopia with him. Emma told him he shouldn't have assumed as much. She revealed that he has forced her to sacrifice everything she believes in, everything she loves to be with him on Utopia. She believed in teaching the next generation, not in fighting. After explaining why she should leave, Emma reveals that she liquidated her company in order to bankroll Utopia since Angel would be leaving. She did it even before Scott asked if she would be staying, showing that she'd already resolved to remain with him.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma stays with Scott on Utopia where she liquidates her company in order to bankroll Utopia for the time being. She is on Scott's Extinction Team along with Hope, Colossus, Magik, Danger, Magneto, Namor and Storm. Emma and the team are alarmed of the Dreaming Celestial being activated by Mr. Sinister. They engage him in battle and Emma ends up losing one of her diamond arms due to a blast from a celestial probe. Emma and the team fought the Sinister people until Mr. Sinister invites them into to his domain. Sinister telepathically controls the team, but due to being in her diamond form Emma is immune but surrounded. Emma told Hope a code word that replicates Emma's diamond form to protect Hope from Sinister prior to entering his domain. With Sinister shot through the head by Hope thanks to Emma, the team is freed from his telepathic control but Sinister predicts this would happen and the team learns Sinister's copies have become a hive-mind-like species.Emma and the team continue to battle the Sinister Species when Emma realizes that Sinister is using Cyclop's mind as a blueprint for his species. Emma has Namor hold her left arm as a tourniquet and abandons her diamond form where she successfully uses her telepathy to mind blast the Sinisters. However, a new Sinister arrives saying he integrated the new data that the previous Sinisters received, and shoots himself after teleporting his palace away.The Dreaming Celestial's head attaches to its body as the rest of the Celestials land. Emma is about to be told to leave by Scott but cuts him short refusing to go. The team stares the Celestials down vowing to protect the Dreaming Celestial and Earth. A group of people gathers looking at the X-men but they do nothing, no throwing things, no derogatory slurs. They only show fear which was Cyclops' initial plan all along. Emma's diamond arm was eventually reattached by a molecular weaving machine made by X-Club.Emma was seen training, getting back into to fighting condition after her arm reattachment. She had a brief conversation with Namor and left while noticing Scott was on edge about something. She was later deployed with the Extinction team to deal with the escaped prisoners from the Peak space prison station and when the Avengers showed up to deal with further escapees. She teams up with Iron Man, Colossus and Red Hulk to face Xemnu the Titan While Colossus holds off Xemnu, Emma and Tony make a psionic shielding device for the Red Hulk to protect him from Xemnu's telepathy. With the device complete, the combined might of Colossus and Red Hulk was enough to defeat the alien.With Hope taken captive by Unit, the Extinction team takes leave from the Avengers to save Hope. Emma and the team are teleported there by Magik where Emma tries to invade Unit's mind. Unit uses a fake double mind, which is what he used in the first place to make a false mutant detection signal in order to draw out Hope, allowing him the chance to shoot a small laser at Emma stunning her. He then uses a pheromone barrage on her and Namor forcing them to become intimate on the battlefield which makes Scott angry and jealous causing him to blast Unit. With Unit's eventual defeat at the hands of Danger, the team returns home where Emma apologizes to Scott for what happened with her and Namor. He tells her that he was alright with what happened since she was forced to do so and had no choice in the matter.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma sides with the X-Men where she tried to take Hope deeper into Utopia away from the Avengers and the battle. She was close to telepathically shutting down the Avenger's mental defenses when Iron Man shows up using a nanotech taser cloud to block her telepathy. Emma is forced into her diamond form and after a brief battle with Iron Man is defeated shortly after until Magneto shows up to battle Iron Man, saving her. After the Avengers have soundly won the Battle of Utopia and Hope has run off, Cyclops surrenders the X-Men. The Avengers become aware that this is just a ruse, as Cyclops has Magik teleport the X-Men away. Emma is with Scott when he visits the Jean Grey School to ask for recruits and sanctuary. A brief battle with Wolverine's X-Men ensues, and the Extinction Team leaves the premises. They find out Hope is heading to the moon. Emma, and four other mutants, Cyclops, Magik, Colossus, and Namor, acquire a share of the Phoenix thanks to Iron Man using a new armor to stop it from bonding with Hope. Emma and the rest of the Phoenix Five take Hope back to Earth in order to prepare for future events. They announce they will cleanse the Earth.Emma and the rest of the Phoenix Five fix the Earth by ending hunger, providing an unlimited source of free, clean energy and water, and also outlaw war 'Pax Utopia'. In order to outlaw war, they destroy all large weapons including sentinels, missiles, submarines, tanks, etc. Emma destroyed sentinels from all around the world. In order to complete this job, she arrived at Avengers Academy to destroy the sentinel belonging to Juston. Despite its being a killing machine, Justin has grown attached to the sentinel and refuses to let Emma destroy it. The students of the Academy step in to prevent Emma from taking the sentinel apart. Hank Pym joins the fray, and together they make a stand against Emma, who easily tosses them around with her new powers. She cannot understand why the students would want to protect a mutant-hunting robot. She is most surprised by X-23 who attacks Emma to defend her friend. Laura is a mutant and Emma believed that she would side with her. Emma was able to thwart Laura's attack by shifting into diamond form. Emma offered to simply wipe the processing unit of the sentinel so that its prime directive to "Destroy all mutants!" would be erased. Juston wouldn't allow this claiming that it would do away with the sentinel's personality. Having been unable to reach a compromise, Emma decided to simply destroy the machine. Rather than melting it, however, she took it apart, so that Justin could rebuild it with a new unit. She melted its core so that it could not be used again. After extending an invitation to X-23 (that was hastily rejected), Emma took her leave of the school. Unbeknownst to her, Quicksilver had switched out the sentinel's unit with his super speed so that the sentinel would be safe after all. Emma's battle at Avengers Academy led to Hank Pym's announcement that the school would be closed because it was unsafe.Later, Emma and Namor talk about Transonic being imprisoned. Namor is disgusted with it and Emma tells him she knows where the girl is. In what appears to be a manipulative moment for Emma, most likely due to the corruption and the power of the part of the Phoenix Force in her, kisses Namor and tells him Transonic is in Wakanda and that she, Emma, hasn't told Scott about her whereabouts.Another scuffle with the Avengers occurs when the Avengers invade a remodeled Utopia (which now ascends all the way into the sky with all new levels of paradise) to snatch away Hope Summers. Emma and Scott prepare to battle the Avengers and permanently end the conflict, but the Scarlet Witch intervenes and teleports a voluntary Hope and the Avengers away. Emma talks with Cyclops who goes on to say that despite all the good X-Men do and all the good they have done, mankind still hates and fears them. That they will always be pushed further into a corner and steal away their innocent despite being endangered so few. The humans will always send their "heroes" to attack the mutants and continue to push them around. She watches as Cyclops simply states "No more Avengers." He plans to take the Avengers off the board, permanently.With Magneto bringing Namor's actions to Scott's attention, he questions Emma. Emma tells him Namor is his own man and that Scott has no authority over him. Emma tells him to look at the benefit of what happened with the Avengers being found. Emma and the rest of the Phoenix Five go to Wakanda wherein Namor's defeat, they absorb his share of the Phoenix Force. Emma calls for a meeting with Scott in the remote location of the Danakil Desert in Ethiopia. Emma and he talk and she go on to say she has reached into every mind on Earth. Scott tells her that she needs to stop sounding like Namor and that this isn't a war and she needs to come home. Emma tells Scott that Hope is in K'un Lun. Scott rushes off to retrieve Hope leaving Emma in mid-sentence begging for him to stop her as she is scared of what she might do next as the Phoenix Force's influence corrupts her further. She ends up making a man who had a hit and runs accident with a thirteen-year-old mutant boy years ago and never reported it just because he was a mutant, brain dead. When Colossus and Magik fight, they manage to knock each other out in an attempt to gain the other's portion of the Phoenix Force. They are returned to their normal forms as their portions of the Phoenix Force leave them and presumably go to Emma and Scott.Emma is now almost completely corrupted by the Phoenix Force. She has forced all the remaining X-Men to bow down and worship her. Only one resisted and that was Magneto. Emma explains that she is indeed the more powerful of the two which spites Magneto to contact Xavier saying both Emma and Scott are completely gone. Scott is in need of more power after his defeat at the hands of Hope taking the power of Iron Fist and Scarlet witch so he is heading after Emma.Emma talks with Scott telling him she can read his thoughts about how he thinks he might take her half. Emma begins to go on on a rant threatening to burn the world but Cyclops yells at her to stop talking like that and asks what has gotten into her. She replies with a worried look that she doesn't know. The Avengers and X-Men attack the two remaining avatars and they fight back. As the fight continues on the outside, Emma and Cyclops have a psychic dinner discussing things. Emma reveals to Scott even more disturbing tendencies such as using human blood as a sauce for a steak. She tells him about the psychic affair and that she truly loves him. She continues to talk about destroying the world and that she will be a queen of ash and they will just rebuild anew. Emma's corruption is almost complete and Cyclops realizes this. He asks for her forgiveness as Emma is stricken down by him and her half of the force is absorbed. Emma is arrested by the Avengers who are then attacked by Purifier being labeled as mutant sympathizers. The Avengers defeat them and then Emma is escorted to prison and the Extinction team is revealed to still be active.</hero:storyDescription>

Emma is furious at Scott for all his actions and betrayal and Cyclops tells her it wasn't him and it was the Phoenix. Emma storms off and Cyclops tells her to read his mind to show her how sorry he really is but Emma reveals she cannot as the Phoenix altered their powers and her telepathy is gone. Emma also tells Scott they best not be near each other and when she was seemingly going to end the relationship right then and there, the cops start heading towards them as Magik teleports the group away. In Australia, a new mutant girl named Eva has just awakened her powers after her overprotective brother started a fight. The girl formed a time sphere around a block in Australia with the Police and Federal Guard outside the sphere. Emma tells the mutant girl that these are the scariest times in mutant lives. The team offers to help her learn to control her powers if she will join them. When the temporal sphere goes down, Emma shifts into her diamond form, and along with Magneto and Cyclops, she helps protect Eva and fight off the police forces.With Cyclops and Magneto discussing the issues at hand in a field, Emma tells them both a new mutant has been revealed. When Magik teleports Cyclops and Magneto back to the Weapon X facility, Cyclops storms and Emma asks what happened where Magneto tells her that the Original Five X-Men have been brought to the present. Magneto mentions young Cyclops and Jean Grey which is all Emma needed to hear as she goes to find Cyclops. She finds him on a hill where she starts to ask him what happened. While reluctant, Cyclops tells her that they were all real. Emma ponders who would have the technology and wherewithal to something like this. With Cyclops pointing out Beast would be the only one, Emma figures it makes sense since Cyclops killed Xavier that with Hank not being able to kill Scott would punish him instead. She shows up with Scott and the group to the Jean Grey Institute to deliver his explanation of what happened in Avengers vs X-Men to clear the air and offer the new students to join his side of things at the new Xavier Institute.Emma recently took Jean Grey to Madripoor after promising to train her in her psionic powers. Emma reveals her psychic powers have been repaired with some help from the Cuckoos, and with it she shuts off Jean's telepathy. She sends Jean after the Blob, and Jean managed to defeat him.

Fabio is being detained by the police at the time of his powers awakening and causing a commotion. The X-Men manage to stop the police but are soon attacked by a group of sentinels. The veteran X-Men manage to defeat the sentinels, even with their altered powers with Cyclops delivering the final blow, leveling the entire area as the group stare in amazement at his power. After the defeated sentinels, the revolutionary group of X-Men leave with Fabio and return the new Xavier Institute. Emma has a break down outside and discovers that she is now projecting her thoughts at random. She has a deep conversation with Scott about their current situation. While they agree they are separated, they show they still care about each other and will continue to work with each other for the betterment of the students. They head inside the new school and go over the current mutant situation. The team teleports to Australia to visit Eva Bell's mother, and not long after showing up, the X-Men and recruits are intercepted by an Avengers squad.Emma and Scott stand up to the Avengers with the bold proclamation that the Avengers are the ones responsible for the death of Charles Xavier. After some statements from Cyclops and the Avengers almost assaulting the X team, Eva Bell freezes them in a temporal bubble. Cyclops makes the statement that the X-Men will protect all the mutants and humans that support them and that a warning to the people who will deny them their freedom has been issued. The X team is transported back to the New Xavier Institute where Magneto is revealed to be the mole. The team shows disgust at the reveal except for Emma, who realizes that Magneto being a double agent is an ingenious plan and even convinces Scott it can play to their advantage. Emma, along with the rest of the veteran mutant team, are transported by Magik to the Jean Grey Institute.When they show up to the Jean Grey Institute, Scott goes off on his explanation of his side in the story and in the meantime, Emma confronts the Stepford Cuckoos where they figure out she does not have her telepathy and realize that is why Emma never made contact. The Cuckoos psychically torture Emma to a degree about it and uncover what happened between her and Scott. Emma doesn't blame them for their actions as she does understand they are just like her. Emma and the Cuckoos then have a psychic conversation about the events happening at the school with the original X-Men coming to the future. The Cuckoos do make mention of Jean Grey and that she is still very untrained, as they have been reading her mind quite frequently. Emma tells the Cuckoos to come with her to the Xavier School where she will continue to train them. Emma and the group leave for a period to return to their school and find the new mutants getting attacked by the Danger Room. It is then that Magik's powers show her broken state as she screams out in pain, briefly disappears, and reappears in a small burst of flames. Emma and the veteran X-Men leave once more for the Jean Grey school and upon their return, the Cuckoos have come to the new Xavier Institute along with the younger version of Angel.After Magik's powers go off again, Cyclops has a talk with her and brings her back. Emma, along with the rest of the team, are forcibly pulled into Limbo where Illyana has transformed into Darkchilde.It is revealed that the team was forcibly transported into Limbo by Dormammu so he could kill the team to spite Magik and eventually kill her. Emma transforms into diamond form to keep herself protected and when Dormammu commands his mindless ones to attack the team, Emma gets the Stepford Cuckoos to turn the fearful new mutant's mindsets into bravery, thus giving them to courage to fight back. Emma and the rest of the team fight the minions to save themselves and Magik.Emma continues battling the mindless ones and the group is soon getting overwhelmed with some getting injured. Magik manages to free herself and cast everyone out while absorbing the entire dimension into herself. One of the students, Benjamin, is nearly dead, but Emma coaches Christopher through the use of his ability and saves him. Scott apologizes to the team and tells them they all must train. Emma and Scott escort Fabio home, as he could not handle the pressure that comes with being an X-man. Emma tells the team not to worry as new mutants are popping up all over the world, and the team rescues and recruits a new mutant by the name of David Bond, who has the ability to control cars. Emma is seen coaching David when he is controlling a massive plane just outside of the compound. When Irma of the Stepford Cuckoos dyes her hair, Emma is seen escorting her back inside when Celeste freaks out on her. Emma helps the team invade the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier when they catch word of Fabio being kidnapped and interrogated and the team manages to successfully save Fabio.Emma and Scott are training the students, but the former couple ends up having a small argument. After watching Eva perform a new ability with her powers, Emma and the rest of the X-Men end up watching a pro-mutant rally in honor of Scott. The X-Men go and join the rally where Emma watches Scott give a speech, but not long after a new sentinel attacks them.The Blockbuster sentinel attacks, and appears to vaporize him. Much to worry about Emma, but due to a timely save from Magik, he is alright. Emma goes diamond and charges the machine, only to be knocked back and caught by Angel. The rest of the X-Men try their luck at attacking it, but the sentinel keeps adapting. Eventually, Magneto arrives and does a final attack. The Sentinel appears to ready to explode, and with Cyclops demanding the robot tell him who sent it, Emma saves Scott before it does leave an explosion, but only due to the assailant calling it back.During a training session, Emma watches as Cyclops is being especially hard on Benjamin for giving up in a training exercise. When Benjamin gets out of the shower, Emma is clad in different clothes and begins to get close to the student in an attempt to make him uncomfortable and push him to get his powers to activate. The attempt works as Emma picks up on his traits and comes to the conclusion that he is more than just a shape-shifter, and that he can mess with technology, and that he releases a pheromone of sorts that makes people feel good about themselves. Emma and Magik take him to Atlanta, Georgia where they put his powers to the test. Emma ends up having the student run an actual mission. She hands him a letter and tells Benjamin to bring it all the way up to Timothy Dugan's office with a note telling him that in someone inside SHIELD is attacking mutants. Benjamin ends up passing and Emma tells Scott about his successful mission.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma Frost was recruited by a mysterious boss during the events of Original Sin to join a team of three that included Ant-Man and the Black Panther. Other teams of two or three were also being formed, and each group led a mini-investigation of the death of Uatu the Watcher. Their investigations would eventually lead all the involved parties to a supposedly secret space station, in which all the teams argued with each other and tried to answer some of their questions. Who had led them there? Who were they working for? And why? Fighting broke out as an enraged Gamora threatened the Winter Soldier who appeared to have murdered Nick Fury. Emma Frost came to his defense, shifting into diamond form, and smashing her fist into Gamora, who returned the blow in kind. Eventually, things cleared up. The Nick Fury that Bucky had "killed" was actually a Life Model Decoy. The real Nick Fury revealed himself to the teams as the mysterious boss that they had been working for. He explained his story to them - that he was the "man on the wall" doing terrible things to defend Earth. He had selected each of them and led them to the space station so that he might choose one of them to become his successor. He believed they each possessed a special and lethal set of skills that would make them right for the job. The Avengers back on Earth soon caught on, and made their way to the space station to investigate. A battle between the Avengers, Fury, and Fury's possible successors ensued. When all was cleared up, and Fury was presumed dead, the heroes, including Emma returned to Earth ... except for Thor, who because of something Fury whispered to him, was unworthy of his hammer, and could no longer lift it.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma is seen with Dazzler, Magneto, and Magik at Mystique's old hideout in search of her. They find nothing and head back to the New Xavier School. Emma talks with Scott that he needs to apologize to David for kicking him off the team. Later on, the Jean Grey Institute Staff arrive at Scott's school and tell him that he needs to come with them about Xavier's will. Emma volunteers to go in Scott's place, but they all head to the JGS, and there She-Hulk begins reading the will and announces that Xavier was married to Mystique. Emma ends up being the only one to laugh at the new found revelation. Emma sat and listened with most of the Will as Xavier explained how he was forced to psychically and slowly, lobotomize a young mutant by the name of Matthew Malloy since Xavier could not help him and his powers were too strong to control. After Xavier mentions that this goes against everything he taught the X-Men that no mutant should ever be left behind, but he did to this one, only periodically reinforcing the psychic blocks he built in the child over the years. With Xavier telling them that the rest of the will is to be played after Cyclops and Wolverine, along with Rachel Grey, reinforce the mental blocks on Matthew, Cyclops has an outburst of anger. While he refuses to help Xavier due to being lied to, Emma is the only one who seems to get through to him, and thus, he leaves for Xavier's final request with Emma staying behind at the Jean Grey Institute.Emma is with Kitty and Dazzler when Beast walks in with the rest of the JGS staff to warn them that no one is going to help them, but that SHIELD is planning on attacking and killing Malloy, whom Cyclops is with. Beast gets an update that Scott was killed during an attack on Malloy. Upon hearing this, Emma storms out of the Jean Grey School and onto the lawn, and in her grief, causes a massive psychic projection that harms the staff and students of the school along with the Cuckoos back at the New Xavier School. Matthew Malloy appears on the front lawn in front of her, and Emma asks if he was there with Scott. After he replies yes, Emma punches him, and in reflex Malloy accidentally kills her.After Eva goes back in time to find a younger Xavier, she tells him what is going on, and they fix it by making sure Malloy's parents never conceive Matthew and Eva return back to her timeline, which has then prevented any of the teachers from dying. The will is finished and Scott inherits the Jean Grey School, but he signs it over to Storm and asks for her to take in his students, and all Emma says is Scott just shut down the school.After the events of the Last Will and Testament of Charles Xavier, Scott has shut down his school and transferred the students to the Jean Grey Institute. Emma questions Scott about the revolution and what it truly meant. She suggests they start all over. Scott shoots her down, but Emma reveals her powers have returned and that he is conflicted about her and that she is to him as well. She wishes him good luck and she leaves the school.</hero:storyDescription>

The Cuckoos help her project this image of Cyclops to everyone on the entire planet. Emma's projection of Cyclops gives a speech, warning everyone about the toxicity of the Terrigen Mist. She uses this projection to warn the world of the cloud, recruit the mutant known as Alchemist to alter the cloud and destroy one of them. She uses this projection to attack the Inhumans and destroys half of the Terrigen Mists. The Inhuman royals intervene and the projection of Cyclops 'dies' at the hands of Black Bolt, giving Cyclops a meaningful death. Emma later reveals to Havok that Cyclops died before all of this and that she simply wanted to give his death meaning for all that he did for the world.

Emma infiltrates Black Bolt's club and uses Dazzler to take out the former king and most powerful Inhuman, thus starting their official attack on the Inhumans. In her diamond form, she is impervious to his vocal blasts, and smashes his voice box, breaking his jaw and preventing Black Bolt from using his powers.As the events of IvX roll on, Emma leads the mutants against the Inhumans in a final battle.

With the help of Sebastian Shaw, Hank McCoy, and Xorn, Emma forms New Tian - the new mutant homeland. As a part of her deal with Hydra, Emma keeps the mutant population docile by telepathically controlling them. She also controls Xorn, who is a mere figurehead she has propped up as the King of New Tian. Emma operates from the former X-Men base of Utopia, which has been rebuilt. New Tian's mission is to take in all refugees, human or mutant, but mutants tend to be treated better in New Tian.Though Emma has thrown in with Hydra, she does not condone their actions and is merely using them to keep mutants safe in this new world. Behind the scenes, she is working against them. She has stolen a piece of the cosmic cube from Shang Chi and intends on using it against Captain America and Hydra. The members of X-Men Blue, led by the time-displaced Jean Grey and guided in secret by Magneto, attack New Tian believing that Emma is a Hydra villain. Emma's allies confront them, and Cyclops is taken to her citadel. Emma telepathically toys with teenage Cyclops, until the other X-Men come to free him.Eventually, Captain America realizes Emma has a piece of the cube and sends Hydra forces to invade New Tian. The invasion force has orders to bring Emma in, along with the cube fragment. Emma refuses, saying she will go and hand the fragment in herself as a sign of good will, and she will negotiate a cease-fire, not a surrender. She threatens to unleash King Xorn on the Hydra forces if they do not accept her terms. Emma marches into the capital, while the remaining heroes are fighting Hydra forces. The battle looks bleak until Captain America tells Emma he will not allow a ceasefire and will instead attack the mutants. Emma turns on him, promising no mutant will kneel to Hydra, and orders Magneto to tear Captain America's aircraft out of the sky, turning the tide of the battle.When Hydra has been defeated, Emma must once again negotiate with the US government, and the kingdom of New Tian is torn down, by Sentinels, no less, and the population is reintegrated with the United States.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma is a powerful and experienced telepath. Her psionic powers allow her to perform several feats such as mental communication, mind reading, mind control, induce paralysis, possession, hypnosis, pain stimulation, illusion casting, astral projection, psychic surgery, and by collecting ambient psionic energy she can create powerful psionic lightning bolts or "psi-bolts", that can attack on a physical or mental level and are capable of rendering a person unconscious or even killing them. Emma's telepathy is powerful enough to communicate and affect people all the way across the planet. She has even done a mental broadcasting of Cyclops' own thoughts to all of the remaining mutants that were left on the Earth. Emma has also displayed psychometric powers, having taught a class of young mutants how to do so, as well. Using her telepathy, she can also psionically shut off another's mutant's telepathy.Emma has been stated to be an "Omega Class Telepath" (the same classification as Charles Xavier), a level 10 psi and one of the top five telepaths on Earth. Emma's telepathy manifested itself in her teens, and she has devoted her life to mastering her many psychic skills. For a period following the death of Jean Grey and the de-powering of Professor Xavier (though he has since regained his abilities), Emma has acted as the X-Men's primary telepath.After utilizing and losing the Phoenix Force post-Avengers vs X-Men, Emma's powers have been altered with her losing most of her telepathy as result. Another side effect of the Phoenix Force altering her powers, Emma now projects her thoughts unto people at random intervals with no control over this change.Despite the initial loss of her telepathy, for awhile Emma only had a modicum of her previous power levels. Emma is still one of the most skilled telepaths on Marvel Earth. In place of her shattered telepathy, she was relying upon on the powers of other telepaths to which she uses her own mind as a conduit for, such as the Stepford Cuckoos' or the young Jean Grey's telepathic powers. This enables her to engage in telepathic battles and make full use of her skill since the younger mutants do not possess the knowledge she does. Emma recently revealed that her broken telepathic powers have been repaired and back at her normal levels due to training with the Stepford Cuckoos.Her power levels have increased to the point where she was able to create and sustain a projection of Cyclops for an extended period of time. She was able to project her thoughts to the entire world, with the aid of the Cuckoos. This projection of Cyclops was even caught on camera, suggesting that Emma's illusions are not just in the mind of her targets.</hero:powerDescription>

  <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma gained a secondary mutation during the destruction of Genosha, which manifested as complete transmutation of her organic tissues into a diamond-like substance. It was later revealed in a flashback that Cassandra Nova possibly catalyzed Emma's secondary mutation in order to allow her to survive the harsh environment of Genosha (however, it is still questionable if this is really true). This ability allows Emma to turn into an un-living yet sentient and mobile diamond form, granting her extreme resistance to damage, invulnerability to cold and heat, enhanced speed, super strength (no limit has been clearly defined but handbooks say approximately 2 tons), immortality, and limitless stamina as her body does not tire or produce any fatigue toxins while in this form. She also does not feel pain or emotions and has no need to eat, sleep, or drink while in diamond form. A drawback of her diamond form is she can not access her telepathy, but in return, it grants her telepathic immunity to all but a few telepaths. Emma can stay transformed for as long as she likes, and the speed it takes for her to transform in and out of her diamond form is almost instantaneous, being described as happening within a hundredth of a second.Emma's diamond form has stood up to Cyclops' optic blasts, jet crashes, blasts from Bishop, hits from World War Hulk, the collapse of Genosha, a blast from Black Bolt, and even a blast from the Dreaming Celestial's head when it was taken over by Mr. Sinister. Emma can be broken if hit with the appropriate amount of force, appropriate weapon and her shatter point (believed to be somewhere on her forehead). Her first instance of entirely shattering was due to a diamond bullet hitting her in her shatter point at extremely high speeds. In her second instance of breaking (this did not involve her shatter point), Emma's arm was cut off when attacked by one of the Dreaming Celestial's "mini celestial" probes its body broke into. Despite her arm breaking off, this shows an impressive upper limit to the kind of damage her diamond form can take, considering one of them was able to blast a massive hole in Colossus' chest and send him flying across San Francisco.</hero:powerDescription>

She gains the ability to manipulate the Phoenix' cosmic energy for various purposes such as setting enemies on fire or simply projecting it as energy blasts. She also gains telekinetic capabilities and the ability to fly. Her telepathy has grown in strength as she was capable of reaching into every mind on Earth. She gains a massive strength boost easily putting her in class 100+ as she was able to fight and defeat a Mjolnir wielding Thor without much difficulty using nothing but physical combat. In her diamond form, she becomes almost completely invulnerable as X-23's adamantium claws could not cut her.Perhaps Emma's most unique ability gained from the Phoenix is when Thor "shattered" her, (it is possible Emma feigned Thor actually shattering her considering she was playing with him the entire fight) she had conscious control over all the fragments and rained them down through him and then reformed herself, showing Emma in her diamond form combined with the Phoenix Force is possibly unkillable. Despite her new found powers, Emma is not without weakness. Special Shi'ar weaponry, the Iron Fist energy from K'un-Lun and the Scarlet Witch's chaos magic have all been shown to harm them. However, as the Avatars gained more power when one falls, the Scarlet Witch's magic has grown to be less and less effective.

When she possessed Iceman's body, she was able to use his powers in ways he had never been capable of before. Emma was the one that discovered Cyclops' inability to control his optic blasts was actually the result of mental blocks that Scott imposed on himself at a young age (and not physical brain damage, as was previously believed) and performed 'psychic surgery' that allowed him to control his powers for a time.</hero:powerDescription>

Emma doesn't age while in her Diamond form, but she can't use her psionic powers so she doesn't maintain it normally. In a 2020 story arc for Captain Marvel, where Carol is trapped in an After the End future, Emma had been staying in Diamond form and when she transforms she looks the same as she does now, in contrast Jessica Drew looked well in to her 60s or 70s and was physically frailer than before (her son had to help her out a bit, when she wasn't sheltered against the cold).</hero:tropeDescription>

Emma answered that Evil Sisters Want Happy Brothers and she was doing things that will hurt Christian.

In Astonishing X-Men she makes an off-handed reference to having the "best body money can buy." It's generally accepted by fans that she got breast implants.

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Emma Frost possesses telepathic abilities of a similar, or slightly lower, caliber to those of Charles Xavier, over which she had an extremely refined level of skillnote  It's often implied that while Emma is much stronger in terms of sheer raw power, only falling short of Omega-level Telepaths like Jean Grey and Quentin Quire, Xavier still trumps her in terms of experience (as he is both significantly older than Frost and got his powers at an earlier age). Frost has been cited as a "World-class telepath", "Omega Class Telepath" and a "Psi of the Highest Order" capable of extraordinary telepathic feats. When Wolverine thought to be protected from her thanks to Level 9 Psi-Shields created by Charles Xavier, she stated she was herself Level 10. More specifically, since her introduction, Emma has displayed the telepathic standards of broadcasting and receiving thoughts, mind-control, altering perceptions and memories, projection of offensive blasts of psionic energy causing mental pain or unconsciousness, Astral Projection, mind switching, brain engram modification, mental sedation of unconscious victims, induction of mental pain by touch and limited psychometry...in short, every form of Mind Rape.

Emma's Control Freak of a father gets the teacher fired (and forbids him from ever seeing Emma again). They later meet again when Emma ends up attending a college where he is teaching. There the teacher, Emma, her telepathic roommate, and Emma's new best friend get involved in a love rectangle where the roommate telepathically manipulates the best friend into accusing Emma of sexual advances in order to remove the two people standing between her and Emma. In response to this revelation, Emma mind wipes her roommate, then uses her own psychic power to hijack her best friend's mind and make everyone think she's a lying, crazy stalker. Afterward, Emma confesses to Ian what she did in order to protect him, in the name of being honest with the man she loves in hopes that he would not hold it against her in the event he wanted to begin a relationship with her at last. Unfortunately, finding out that Emma was a mutant AND had used her psychic powers to get her best friend labelled insane causes him to reject Emma, turning her into the cold-blooded villain she would become.</hero:tropeDescription>

Basically, its because Apollo thinks their victims deserve to know that their abusers are gone and will never come back. The comparison to Thou Shall Not Kill type superheroes like Batman or Superman isn't spelled out, but from the contextnote Apollo had just been explaining how his father threw him out when he came out as gay at age 12. And then just a year later, aliens abducted him and torturously turned him into what he is now over the course of his teenage years. And after finally escaping, his asshole father rejected him again, now also for being "inhuman"., it can be deduced that he thinks that these heroes are simply too privileged (white; straight; filthy rich or having a supportive family; not having been forced into their metahuman status; never having been personally tortured/abused/victimized, or at least not at a time when they were still helpless civilians, instead mostly getting Mangst type drama about other people getting hurt) to ever truly empathize with the victims of the villains they're throwing in prison only for them to escape again and again to destroy the lives of more innocent people. Note that Apollo's Establishing Character Moment on the New 52 Stormwatch reboot was taking down a child pornography ring, not dealing with some alien threat or a fantastical and crazy villain like most of Batman's rogues gallery.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma appears as one of the main characters in the series, voiced by Kari Wahlgren.Uninvited, Emma Frost first appears at the mansion's front door seeking to join the X-Men. Wolverine refuses her, but is eventually forced to accept her into the team since she is the only telepath available and therefore the only one able to operate Cerebro. She successfully located Charles Xavier's lifeless body in the heart of Magneto's Genosha, but later attempts to locate Jean Grey were less successful. In an effort to remain on the team she informs Cyclops that 'given time I could locate her, but if [Wolverine] has his way I'll be gone tomorrow'. Frost is intelligent and tactical, and is an extremely powerful telepath. Her first telepathic fight as an X-Man was against the Shadow King. Storm had been manipulated into believing that Africa was burning and used her mutant powers to put the fires out. However, in reality she was tearing the country apart with rain storms and tornadoes.It was Emma's telepathic powers that saved Storm's life, the whole continent of Africa, and eventually defeat the Shadow King. Later on she was able to disable Psylocke's telepathic attacks with relative ease. Despite Wolverine's initial distrust of Frost, he has grown to accept her as a permanent member of the team.Her battle against the Shadow King and her success to mend some of Wolverine's memories of his time in Weapon X have earned his respect. However, she is extremely secretive and on one occasion lied to Wolverine about Forge's availability. She also appears to be fond of Cyclops, often watching him from afar. Cyclops is still depressed for the loss of Jean Grey. Emma offered to delete his memories of Jean and make him normal again.Emma betrays the X-Men after Jean is found. It is revealed that she has been working for the Inner Circle in an attempt to destroy the Phoenix Force. The Inner Circle then double crosses Emma and tries to use the Phoenix for their own ends. It, however proves too powerful for them to control. When the Phoenix Force is released and is searching for Jean, Emma traps it in her body, transforms into diamond and projects it into the atmosphere where it cannot find a host. She manages to ask Cyclops to forgive her before shattering and seemingly dies.X-Men (2012)In the Japanese X-Men anime, Emma is found to by the Astonishing X-Men (Beast, Cyclops, Logan and Storm) in a pod next to Armor in the U-Men Lab. It is revealed that Emma was kidnapped by the U-Men while searching for Hisako, her missing student. After copping the blame for forcing Jean Grey to commit suicide as Dark Phoenix, Emma joins the X-Men as to continue her tutelage of Armor. She even goes as far as allowing Xavier to view her mind and broadcast her life to the X-Men to gain Cyclops' trust.As the series goes on she is shown to care for younger mutants and enjoys teaching the next generation, a more motherly aspect - but still retains her ever-observant and cunning personality.Whilst Emma is shown to use both her Telepathy and Diamond Form, she lacks any of the hand-to-hand combat training and relies heavily on her Diamond Form to take a more defensive position in the team. She is voiced by Kaori Yamagata in the Japanese version, and by Ali Hillis in the English dub.</hero:mediaDescription>

  <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma Frost appears in the 2011 film, X-Men: First Class and is portrayed by January Jones. She is shown to be the White Queen of the Hellfire Club lead by Sebastian Shaw. She is first shown when Moria MacTaggert sneaks into the Hellfire Club's quarters looking for Colonel Hendry. She is next seen going to meet with a Russian general who Shaw is supposed to meet. Professor Xavier and Magneto also infiltrate the building Emma is in and confront her. She is then captured and taken to the CIA headquarters. Months later, Magneto and his Brotherhood free her from her prison and ask her to join them, to which she agrees. She displays incredibly impressive telepathy defeating and blocking out Charles Xavier several times. She also possesses her diamond form which seems to augment her strength (she was able to send Erik flying into the sea with a single blow) and renders her immune to telepathy. However it does not seem to provide her any physical durability as Erik almost killed her by strangling her with the metal railing of a bed while she was in diamond form (a close up clearly shows it beginning to shatter around the area the pressure was applied, her neck) and Charles had to persuade him not to kill her, which he surely would have. In this incarnation, Emma seems to play more of a henchman-type second-in-command role rather than more of an equal power player as she was in the comics when she was the White Queen.</hero:mediaDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">However, it was not to be. Less than a year after Apollo and Midnighter's retirement, nearly the entire Stormwatch team was slaughtered in an Aliens/Stormwatch Crossover. Jenny Sparks would develop her vision for a new team, known as the Authority, and she approached Apollo and Midnighter about joining. Reluctantly (and because of Apollo), Midnighter agreed. It was then that he would take his place as "Night's Bringer of War," on a team consisting of Apollo, Swift, Jack Hawksmoor, the Engineer, the Doctor, and Jenny Sparks. His relationship with Apollo would only be hinted at until the Regis story arc, in which it was confirmed they were a couple.Of the many foes Midnighter faced with the Authority perhaps the most life-altering was the very governments they sought to improve. At one point, the political powers of Earth attempted to overpower the Authority and replace them with The New Authority, consisting of Surgeon, Teuton, Machine, Last Call, Rush, Street, and Union Jack. Of his team members, only Midnighter (along with baby Jenny Quantum) managed to escape capture and evade detection. His skills would ultimately free and save all the other original members of the Authority, though it very nearly cost him his life. Midnighter is notable for being one of the few gay superheroes in print. After his near death at the hands of government creation Seth (where even his backup heart was ripped from his chest), he married his longtime partner, Apollo, in a civil service on the The Carrier. Together, they adopted the reincarnation of Jenny Sparks, Jenny Quantum, as their daughter.Recently, even this happiness has been short lived. Midnighter was manipulated into believing that an Apollo from the future contacted him to tell him how the the Authority would ultimately become the very world oppressors they sought to overcome. This information prompted Midnighter to leave the team, as well as his husband and daughter, and to work alone for a time. However, it was discovered he was being controlled by a still-living Henry Bendix, who then set him in battle against his previous team members after getting on board The Carrier. Fortunately, Bendix's control over Midnighter was broken by the combined efforts of Jenny Quantum and Engineer, freeing him to once again join the team and be with Apollo.</hero:storyDescription>

But he also became certain he never had been Lucas Trent, because Trent was remembered by everyone as a nice and decent man and the Midnighter knew himself to be a gleeful killer through and through. To Jenny's surprise, however, he wasn't angry with her for the deception; instead, he returned to Harmony to impersonate Trent further and practice being a normal person in a normal daily life.

When Apollo is infected by the Warhol virus (now calling itself the Burn), he attacks the Authority, seeking to use the doors to the Bleed as a way of spreading the Burn throughout the multiverse. The team manages to freeze him in order to prevent this from happening. Midnighter has a dream where a Century Baby named Gaia asks him to find her, telling him that she knows how to save Apollo. When he reaches the island that Gaia is stranded on, he finds himself under attack by a god-like force of nature called the Green Man, who turns out to be the former Doctor driven insane by the planet's demise. With the help of the team, Gaia manages to take control of the island and subdue the Doctor so that she can heal him. She gives Midnighter a magical apple and tells him to feed it to the infected Apollo. When he does so, Apollo is cleansed of the Burn and restored to normal.</hero:storyDescription>

He then reveals that he has been following Apollo for quite some time now and has taken an interest upon him because of his power set and the way that he deals with threats. He then offers him a deal of partnership. Martian Manhunter then reveals that he was pretending to be out cold so that he could get a grasp of the situation and the threat presented, and tells the duo that Stormwatch could use both Apollo and Midnighter. He explains that Stormwatch is not in fact a regular superhero team and that the team has little qualms with killing.During this time Adam-One shows up through a door and offers Midnighter a place on the team as well, telling him that his skills are wasted against thugs and criminals when he could be defending the planet with Stormwatch. However, at the same time that this was happening Harry Tanner was up on the moon trying to deal with a alien threat, called the Scourge of Worlds that sent pieces of the moon as meteorites into Earth's atmosphere. This cut short the conversation and Apollo agreed to go deal with the meteors while Midnighter went to deal with a fallen meteor that turned into a rampaging antibody. When they arrived at the scene the antibody proved troublesome and absorbed all the members of Stormwatch present, with the exception of Midnighter. Apollo soon joins him and the two of them, in conjuction with the Projectionist [who was at the base] manage to come up with a successful plan to free their 'team members'. With this done, it allowed Hawksmoor to lead half of the team into an ancient formerly-underground city called Alba Umbra and from there allow Jenny Quantum to power up one of the cities' artifacts to turn the monster into glass.When the team returns to the Eye they discover that the Shadow Cabinet has chosen the Projectionist to be Stormwatch's new leader. While this is going on, Apollo and Midnighter slip away to explore the HQ. Midnighter tells Apollo that the two of them would be more effective together than as components of Stormwatch, since their goals differ greatly from the team's. There is a sudden emergency distress signal from hyperspace, and Apollo leaves to investigate it. Midnighter realizes that the emergency was just a distraction orchestrated by Harry Tanner so that he could steal the Stormwatch data caches. The two fight, with Tanner struggling to land a blow because of Midnighter's ability to predict every one of his moves. Just then, they are interrupted by Projectionist, whom Harry grabs and pulls into hyperspace with him, escaping after setting off a bomb on the alien horn that destroys the Eye. The force of the explosion throws Midnighter into hyperspace, where he lingers for a few death-defying moments until he is rescued by Apollo and taken back to the reformed Eye to be treated for his exposure to the hazardous environs of hyperspace. A short while later, he signs up with Stormwatch after a conversation with the Engineer, managing to persuade Apollo to join as well.</hero:storyDescription>

When Grifter lets slip that he knows about the Daemonite invasion of Earth, Midnighter attacks him, telling him that he cannot allow Grifter to live now that he knows what was supposed to be privileged information. Grifter struggles to fend off the attack, and manages to stun Midnighter by setting off a flare in his face. But even while temporarily blinded, Midnighter is still able to outmatch Grifter, who falls into a crevasse in the snow and is presumed dead (though he manages to save himself at the last moment). Finding nothing of significance in the wreckage, Midnighter opens a door to the Eye and leaves the Himalayas. After he leaves, the prisoner of the Eye slowly reveals himself: the Daemonite known as Helspont, who has plans for the invasion of Earth, plans that involve none other than Superman himself.</hero:storyDescription>

However, a fight breaks out, and it is revealed Midnighter had other things in mind. It turns out that Midnighter used to call London his home and served as it's protector. A nearby apartment building was a hotspot for strange happenings, which he was never able to resolve, and he came back to check up on things. This recent fight is just the most recent in a long line of disturbing and violent occurences in the building, including murder, rape, and torture. He and Apollo suit up to get to the bottom of things, and come across a boy named Lazarus scrawling pictures of demons on the walls using his parent's blood. As they enter the room, the boy, apparently unable to hold it back any longer, calls forth the demon Etrigan. Turns out he had been buried under the building, and it was his influence causing all the violence in the area. Midnighter attacks Etrigan, thinking he can take him while he's still weak, but Etrigan knocks him out with one punch. Apollo, thinking Midnighter dead, angrily attacks Etrigan, until the rest of Stormwatch shows up. Midnighter gets up, not dead after all, and joins in the attack, until they are able to drive Etrigan off. Apollo and Midnighter happily reunite after the fight is over, only to have the Engineer announce that a new rule is going into effect forbidding any romantic relationships between members. Apollo and Midnighter decide later to ignore the rule. Apollo suggests leaving Stormwatch together, but Midnighter declines, saying he feels he's found a home with Stormwatch and that he feels he needs the structure they provide.</hero:storyDescription>

He has a special plan in mind for Midnighter, however.His plan involves tricking small time criminal The Fox into acting as a sort of dimensional portal, which Harry uses to acquire technology needed to disguise himself as one of the Shadow Lords. Harry appears on the Eye of the Storm disguised as a Shadow Lord, and tells Stormwatch that they are to take a more proactive approach to the superbeings on Earth, and tells them to kill Superman, Batman, and Green Lantern, saying they are "a threat" presumably in the hopes that Stormwatch will kill themselves in the attempt, or at least weaken them. The Projectionist also makes a return, and it is revealed that Harry has somehow implanted a false memory in her mind of him dying in an explosion, and plotting against Stormwatch with Midnighter. Midnighter sees through Harry's disguise, and tells the others that Harry is trying to trick them, but to no avail. Harry tells them to arrest Midnighter, who abducts Projectionist and heads out a Door into Antarctica in an effort to uncover evidence that Harry is the 'Shadow Lord'. While tracking Midnighter, he kills several researchers, which he uses to frame Midnighter for murder, and convince Stormwatch that he needs to be killed.</hero:storyDescription>

In one of these run ins Midnighter kidnapped Dick and brought him to the God Garden, where he would use the Garden's technology to remove Dick's implants and place it within himself. Stealing the implant proved to be a mistake as Dick was able to use his knowledge of the implants to beat the Midnighter. Midnighter would end up teaming up with Dick to stop the Fist of Cain from using Paragon's brain to incite a riot at a peace rally in Tel-aviv. After preventing the terrorist attack Midnighter soon parted ways with the Gardener because she had knowledge of the attack but choose not to intervene.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Midnighter's abilities were designed by Bendix to give him an all encompassing advantage in close-combat and tactical scenarios. He has superhuman strength, reflexes (and moving speed when necessary), healing, senses, aim and various other enhancements. He is said to have multiple redundant systems to keep him fighting in the worst of conditions. One example of this is a backup heart. Midnighter can also turn his pain receptors on and off so he can keep fighting when the pain would stop a normal man. The pain is not totally cut off though, so his healing factor is also very helpful. He's fought with, and healed from, a broken neck, broken limbs, holes through his chest, having his whole body set on fire, contracting various viruses (including AIDS) and other things. He can also function perfectly in anaerobic environments when necessary.Midnighter's body has been altered to give him inhuman balance as well as faster nerve endings so he can move and react quicker than any human and many super humans. He normally moves at slightly above human speed but can move so fast that enemies with super speed can't see him. Midnighter's senses allow him to detect any modifications or powers in anyone he looks at, as well as how they work, so he can defeat them. His other senses are so powerful that to trick him, his creator needed to find an alien that could not only change its appearance, but its scent and DNA.Midnighter's most famous ability is his power to predict how a battle will happen before it starts. His fight implants include a combat computer that allows him to run through a given combat situation millions of times in his mind, almost instantly covering nearly every possible result before the first punch is even thrown. He uses this information to predict the actions and or reactions of his foes, counteracting their moves almost before they even think to make them. According to Midnighter, his powers also work by letting him see the outcome of the battle he wants, and working backwards, following the right steps to get there.He liked to begin fights by announcing all of this, but got bored enough with the speech to have it printed on business cards, which he can leave for absent opponents (or kill them by throwing the sharp-edged cards).In the tour-de-force issue Midnighter #7, we see his world view in action as the issue begins at the final scene when he returns from battle to kiss Apollo, and each following page takes us further back in the actions that got him there--ending on the last page with his initial speech</hero:powerDescription>

  <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In the new 52 Midnighter's ability to predict the outcome of any situation still exists, but appears to have been supplemented by a form of precognitive enhanced tactical awareness as well as enhanced knowledge. He is able to finish other people's sentences before they have thought about it, and when Stormwatch's map of alien threats to Earth materialized in front of him and Apollo, he instantly knew what it was. He's even able to defeat Grifter,despite the fact that he was blind.When he fought one of The Hidden people, it was noted that even when one of the neanderthal men was in his feral state. Midnighter seemed to have known what moves he could make before he even made them. He has shown the ability to read body movements and correctly discern what a person's power is (such as Harry Tanner's ability to lie and be believed). He's able to see through Tanner's lies and was able to figure out that The Shadow Lord was Harry (even though everyone else was fooled,and didn't believe him at first). He has significant resistance to telepathic attacks, as he was able to resist the Scourge of Worlds' attempt to use the Martian Manhunter's telepathy on him (to an extent). He mentions that he has carbon-fibre muscles that presumably enhance his strength. Midnighter has easily snapped the Vitruvian Man's neck, broke Apollo's nose and also caused Martian Manhunter pain (and drew blood). He is fast enough to dodge a bullet shot by Grifter at point blank range after it was fired, he also knocked out Martian Manhunter, Jack Hawksmoor and The Projectionist before they could react. Being fast enough to easily move out of the way of machine gun fire from a terrorist (that had the gun directly on him) before the terrorist could react. Harry Tanner reputed to be the world's greatest swordsman, struggled to land even a single blow on Midnighter since the latter could predict every move he would make. After a few seconds of fighting, Midnighter immediately knew what Harry's power was. Midnighter has demonstrated the ability to move so stealthily that the Manhunter and Hawksmoor could not hear or sense his stalking them until it was too late. His suit (which is a carbon armor) enhances his durability as he was able to survive unaided in hyperspace for a while, it also seems to be resistant to energy weapons (such as being shot by Grifter's energy gun yet having no visible signs of damage. Even being resistant to Harry Tanner's energy blades). He also regularly carries knives, throwing stars, grenades, billy clubs &amp; nightsticks etc. He also seems to have some sort of healing factor since his lungs and inner organs healed from the effects of Hyper space. He's also taken hits from a bloodlusted Apollo and Skallox (and stayed conscious). He's drawn blood from Etrigan with a punch, and dodged blasts from Etrigan with ease (something Etrigan even acknowledged).Due to still being relatively new to his older, Wildstorm counterpart, he has less feats (especially since he only appears in the new 52 for approximately 20 issues). Thus having a lot less to draw upon than his older counterpart.Other Versions</hero:powerDescription>

Midnighter's acceptance of what he is, even though he doesn't like it, in contrast with Apollo's conflicting wishes to accept his lover and to make him someone better, someone Midnighter himself could live with more easily, are a central theme in the Midnighter and Apollo mini-series.
