This character is not your ordinary everyday lying jerk. This is the liar so good you never, ever want to play poker ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker"] with them because you'd go home without your underwear and short next week's paycheck.
Obviously, this is a handy talent for a villain to have if the hero group has a Living Lie Detector ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector"], although it can also come in quite handy for a hero who needs to fool the villain for a change. For obvious reasons, it is particularly useful if the Living Lie Detector ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector"] believes that their ability is working, when in fact it is not. Conversely, a more audacious Consummate Liar might make blatantly false or contradictory statements to the Living Lie Detector ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector"] just to show off. Will also use Self-Serving Memory if it will suit their needs. Particularly skilled liars can sometimes even become a Living Lie Detector ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector"] due to all their experiences with lies, and are thus quick to notice when others attempt to lie to them.
Two common variations on Consummate Liar are:
This trope does not apply to tricks such as the Memory Gambit ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemoryGambit"] or Note to Self when they are used as a defense against lie detection. In those tropes, the would-be liar must convince themselves that they are telling the truth. The Consummate Liar knows perfectly well that they are lying. May or may not actually admit, later, that I Lied.
Any character who gives a Bastardly Speech ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardlySpeech"] has no business being anything else.
Compare The Power of Acting ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfActing"]. Contrast Bad Liar. A key trait of the Magnificent Bastard. Their diametric opposite is The Cassandra, someone who always tells the truth but is never believed.
