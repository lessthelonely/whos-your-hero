Hello, Troper. Would you like to know about the Trigger Phrase? Good. Then just sit back and relax.
The Trigger Phrase is a post-hypnotic suggestion used primarily in Speculative Fiction ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction"]. The phrase can activate a Deep Cover Agent or Manchurian Agent, so hidden that the person may not even know they are an agent. The phrase can practically be anything, even a piece of music. It's like a Brown Note specifically programmed into an individual.
Are you feeling okay, Troper? Do you wish me to continue? Good.
The Trigger Phrase may also be used to activate latent physical prowess (or, to use the layman's terms, "asskicking"). A Berserk Button ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton"] that not even the characters themselves know about, used when situations are about to get dangerous. Sometimes, it will help them remember something.
