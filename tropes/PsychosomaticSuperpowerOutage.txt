Super-powers are frequently linked to one's mental state. When the character has unresolved emotional issues, his or her superpowers can stop working. This is universally true of explicitly Psychoactive Powers ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoactivePowers"], but this also can apply to powers that don't normally seem to have a psychoactive component.
Sometimes, there's really nothing wrong with the character's powers; he's just so out of emotional whack that he just can't bring himself to use them.
A Psychosomatic Superpower Outage is often precipitated by loss of self-confidence, loss of faith in one's cause, unresolved emotional conflict, a Freak Out ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut"] or extreme fear.
