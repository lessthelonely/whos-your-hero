Sometimes, it turns out a character who seems to think the world of themselves actually doesn't; their high-and-mighty attitude hides crippling insecurity ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheMask"]. They're often eager, even desperate, to prove themselves, and they won't take it well if their attempt fails. Often, the reason for their insecurity is because they have such a high opinion of themselves that they can't deal with any kind of perceived failure or rejection, bringing the whole thing into a large and angry circle.
Commonly they'll try to feel more secure by putting others down. If they go through a Break the Haughty ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty"] situation, expect it to have shades of Break the Cutie, as this character is almost always a Jerkass Woobie.
May be a trait of the Broken Ace ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce"] and Beta Test Baddie or show up in deconstructions of the Alpha Bitch, Jerk Jock, Bratty Half-Pint, Smug Snake, Smug Super, Sub-Par Supremacist, Insufferable Genius, Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy, Small Name, Big Ego, or even A God Am I (i.e straight superiority complex). Compare Sad Clown, someone who masks their insecurities with humor rather than arrogance. Contrast with Heroic Self-Deprecation, where the person is in fact awesome but the person themselves doesn't believe that they are worth much. Might also overlap with Easily Embarrassed Youngster if they're under 18.
