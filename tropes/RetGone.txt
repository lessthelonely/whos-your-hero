A character seems to vanish off the face of the earth. Sometimes people just disappear ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome"], but this is something more. People who should know about it aren't even sure who the person was. Photos look the same, but without them in it. Their Love Interests either don't exist at all, or are in love with someone else. They never existed. They're not just gone, they're Ret-Gone.
Of course, it's hard to write stories about people who don't exist, so there is normally at least one person who remembers the disappeared character's life ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory"]. Mostly, this will be someone close to the character, such as a friend or family member (and it's often just one person) who will do their best to find evidence, while convincing themselves and others that they're not crazy.
Sometimes, without this character, the world is a notably different place ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail"], but sometimes, hardly anything has changed at all.
Occasionally, it'll be the character themselves, whose continued existence is the only evidence they've ever been alive. They may be Invisible to Normals ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleToNormals"], seeing what the world is like without them. Or they may be alive and well, just really, really annoyed. Cases like this can sometimes cause a Loss of Identity if the character fears that they will start to forget themselves.
Common methods of a Ret-Gone include killing them off at youth or somehow preventing their birth ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherParadox"], shunting them into an Alternate History, and removing them from a metaphysical book of history, or rewriting the book itself in-story, although there are plenty of other Applied Phlebotinum tricks. If we actually see the character vanish and become Ret-Gone, then that character doubles as a Ripple Effect Indicator.
Named, of course, after the Retcon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon"].
A variant of this trope is when the target or targets are subjected to some sort of effect that wipes their existence from memory. They (usually) still exist and their actions have had an effect on the world, but no one remembers them, and the effect may even prevent them from being remembered.
When some shadowy but non-supernatural force erases the evidence of someone's existence in a more mundane manner, they've been Un-Personed ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson"]. When the writers decide to simply "forget" a character's existence, that's Chuck Cunningham Syndrome, when a Delayed Ripple Effect is used as a story device this will often be used to perform a sort of half-hearted Story Reset which may inadvertently 'remove' some characters from creation. When a character actively does this on a large scale, it may be to retcon the universe into being more In Their Own Image.
Keep in mind that doing this to Hitler never works ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlersTimeTravelExemptionAct"].
