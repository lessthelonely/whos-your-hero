Lots of Phlebotinum ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum"] is voice activated: Kirk talked to the computer, Michael talked to KITT, Automan talked to Cursor. But there is no place where a voice activation is more universally required than when triggering a Transformation Sequence.
You are, more or less, not allowed to transform to your super-powered alter-ego without ranting some special key-phrase. This phrase may or may not be descriptive, but it should almost certainly be pithy. If your transformation catchphrase ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndexOfCatchphrases"] is lame, you will not be allowed to keep transforming.
In situations where the hero explicitly cannot transform without magic words ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalIncantation"], rest assured that Easy Amnesia or a Lost Voice Plot will rear its ugly head at least once, making the change impossible when needed the most. If the phrase also untransforms the hero, expect him to do this by mistake sometimes. Villains in particular will often be tricked into saying their power-down phrases.
And woe betide anyone who mispronounces the transformation phrase, as horrible, horrifying things may result.
The trope originated with comic-book character ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTropes"] Billy Batson, who first used the catchphrase "Shazam!" to transform into Captain Marvel in 1940.
For some heroes, the phrase can be omitted when time does not allow, especially if the full Transformation Sequence ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence"] is omitted. Superheroes who do not go through an explicit Transformation Sequence ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence"] (Batman, Superman) are exempt.
A common Anime ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime"] phenomenon; in the Japanese dialog of Sentai and anime, the word "Henshin" — meaning roughly "change" or "transform" — is often found in the phrase, and is sometimes the entire phrase. Other times, the phrase may be entire sentences, or even magic spells (especially in the case of some Magical Girl anime), which again can be one word or entire phrases.
Differs from In the Name of the Moon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheNameOfTheMoon"] in that By The Power Of Grayskull is the activation password for a Transformation Sequence, while In the Name of the Moon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheNameOfTheMoon"] is a harangue directed at the opposition.
This is the magic catchphrase that actually causes or facilitates the transformation. For one that is simply a cool kind of rallying cry or way to get the adrenaline pumping ("Flame On!", for example), see Invocation ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invocation"]. When either of these contains (or is) the name of the hero's new form, it's Transformation Name Announcement.
Nor is it for any kind of words used to trigger magical effects. That would be Magical Incantation ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalIncantation"].
