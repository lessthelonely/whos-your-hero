    <hero:tropeDescription>This occurs when the hero realizes that a villain they are fighting is either not so bad ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain"], after all, has relatable (if still wrong) reasons for doing what they have done, or at least they just sees a vulnerable side in them which makes them empathise to an extent. This sentiment generally is easier to justify in stories with morally ambiguous characters like White-and-Grey Morality, Grey-and-Gray Morality, and even Black-and-Gray Morality. Used well, it can make for greater emotional value and added depth to the villain. If neither of those are the case, it can still show the kindness of the hero who feels bad for their foes, because they know that the villain will always be unhappy and unsatisfied in their cruel lives. When used badly, however, it will make the sympathy feel unwarranted and add needless Wangst. Often the story will have a worse villain to contrast with the sympathetic one and act as a Hate Sink for the audience. Commonly enough, the two characters involved treat each other as Worthy Opponents ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent"] and they may be the target of Foe Romance Subtext. Sometimes, the villain in whom the hero found a glimmer of humanity will die or suffer a Fate Worse than Death to provide angst for the hero or just because the Word of God must "confirm" that they don't support crime and that Redemption Equals Death. If they get killed by another villain, it's almost always a Kick the Dog moment for that villain. If they do survive, they are a prime candidate for a Heelâ€“Face Turn. When it's the audience who feel sympathy for the villain regardless of whether or not the heroes or even the creator do, it's Cry for the Devil ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryForTheDevil"] or Draco in Leather Pants. Compare with Antagonist in Mourning, Last-Second Chance, Rival Turned Evil, Can't Kill You, Still Need You. Contrast Sympathy for the Hero where it's the villain having a similar realization about the hero. The name comes from a 1968 song ["https://tvtropes.orghttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathy_for_the_Devil"] by The Rolling Stones which, incidentally, is not an example of this trope at all; in the song, Satan is sarcastically confessing that he's responsible for all the evil throughout history, when it's really mankind denying their own sins. A common trait of an All-Loving Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero"]. May overlap with Go-Karting with Bowser, Alas, Poor Villain, Enemy Mine, and Mirror Character moments. May induce Cradling Your Kill.</hero:tropeDescription>
