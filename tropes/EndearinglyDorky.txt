This character is a dork â€” they are overall physically or socially awkward, uncool, and likely aren't considered conventionally attractive (Hollywood Homely ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely"] aside). Maybe they are clumsy, exceedingly naive, overly excited about geeky pursuits, have an Annoying Laugh, Cannot Talk to Women, or flounder in social situations. Rather than finding this unlikable, however, other characters often find this sheer dorkiness cute, likable, endearing, or even attractive.
There could be a number of reasons for this. Awkwardness and sweetness or sensitivity often go hand-in-hand, their vulnerability might be seen as attractive ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaknessTurnsHerOn"], they appeal to Cuteness Proximity or maternal instincts, or their appearance is enhanced by their awkward enthusiasm.
Compare Nerds Are Sexy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdsAreSexy"] for when intelligence and geekiness are attractive and see also I'm Taking Her Home with Me!, a verbal reaction to something extremely cute. The Dork Knight is a character who is brave and righteous despite their awkwardness, and therefore usually an example of this trope as well.
This trope is In-Universe Examples Only ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/InUniverseExamplesOnly"]. See also Adorkable for when the viewing audience finds a character cute for being dorky.
