It seems like any major military- or corporate-backed venture to give a mundane person ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles"] superpowers or just enhance their normal abilities results in the test subject going uncontrollably berserk as a side-effect.
Sometimes the choice of test subject is clearly to blame. Convicted criminals are convenient ("One swallow and ten years go off your sentence! ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook"]") but unreliable guinea pigs if you're trying to develop a Super-Soldier who can punch out a tank. Nobody in any of these programs ever seems to have been given the most basic psychiatric evaluation. The evidence indicates a connection between morals and one's ability to remain "sane". Normally, using the power makes you crazy the longer you use it, because Evil Feels Good, but a noble, heroic character is better able to stay in control.
Other times, it seems that insanity happens as a side effect ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum"] for no discernible reason other than to justify the needs of the plot and/or give the super individual a weakness that they must struggle to balance and maintain. This also gives the Badass Normal their one edge over the competition as they lack this weakness. There will be some Technobabble, but this will be the real reason.
Sometimes, the creators of the super being realize the error while in the prototype phase and will seal the subject away ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan"], hoping everyone just forgets about them. Often, the first subject to undergo the process — or a single subsequent subject — will turn out okay, so on top of all the various other issues that the treatment has, it's usually their job to clean up the mess made by subsequent failed attempts. If it's a Science Is Bad story, the sponsors of the program are likely to just keep pumping out nutty prototypes hoping they'll eventually make one that is not insane.
This trope can also arise if the principle that knowledge is power is extended to These Are Things Man Was Not Meant to Know ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow"]. If all else fails, it'll seem like it happened just to make the Aesop "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely" appear in the story. Karmic Death is a frequent end for not only the subject, but the scientists who created him/her/it.
May be either the cause or the result of Science-Related Memetic Disorder ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceRelatedMemeticDisorder"], especially if the person is already a Mad Scientist to begin with.
Invisibility ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleJerkAss"] seems to drive one insane (because when you're out of your sight, you're out of your mind), or at least evil, more than any other power, because it lets you spy on people undetected and escape easily without consequences. H. G. Wells' novel The Invisible Man is the Trope Codifier for invisibility letting you be evil in the modern era, but the germ of the story is much older than that; if you asked Wells where he got the idea he would probably have mentioned Plato's tale of the ring of Gyges (from The Republic).
Shapeshifting and telepathy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMindIsATerribleTHingToRead"] are close seconds to invisibility as potential causes of this trope, probably due to Personality Powers; after all, changing identities too often might result in losing track of the real you, and having other peoples' thoughts in your head is a lot like voices in your head (or can be abused for Big Brother Is Watching). It's crazymaking when telepathy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMindIsATerribleTHingToRead"] tells you people are lying and you can do nothing to prove it. Anything can theoretically trigger it. Getting your powers from otherworldly beings might make you mad by themselves. Getting energy blasts can result in Psycho Electro. Getting Charles Atlas Superpowers can result in Ax-Crazy. Getting Flying Brick powers can result in Beware the Superman. Knowing that one is a Reality Warper will cause A God Am I and the warper to remake the world in his own image. Think of all the Power Perversion Potential!
Cast from Sanity ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromSanity"] is the gameplay form of this trope: apparently "Sanity" has a gauge/number and is some kind of resource/payment to do a skill, i.e., you lose your sanity the more you use it.
This is the inverse of Power Born of Madness ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBornOfMadness"]. God-like powers often give someone a god complex and thus this trope. One possible way to stave this off is to think "A God I Am Not." It always occurs when someone makes serious use of an Artifact of Doom, provided the user isn't eaten on the spot by said artifact.
Not to be confused with With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatResponsibility"]. Compare The Corruption, Almighty Idiot, Drunk with Power, Power High, God for a Day, Mad God.
