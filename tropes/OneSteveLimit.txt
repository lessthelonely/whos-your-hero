A pretty rigid rule that no two characters in a work of fiction (novel, movie, play, TV series, comic book, etc.) should share the same first name, or even similar-sounding names. If there's a Laura in the story, there will not be a Lyra; if there's an Ed, there will not be a Ted (this is sometimes discarded if the characters happen to be twins ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinThemeNaming"]). If you wake up one morning and suddenly discover that you don't know any two people with the same first name and that your phone number begins with 555, you can safely assume you've fallen into a work of fiction.
The rationale behind this is that the audience, actors reading a script and even the writer will get confused by multiple characters with indistinguishable names: "Wait, was it good-guy Steve or bad-guy Steve who launched the missile?" It's even common for scripts to avoid names of similar length and/or first letter.
A strong dramatic reason to duplicate names ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantNameOverlap"] can override the rule, as, for example, in the Jack Nicholson movie The Two Jakes, but it's so rarely done that audiences will pick up on it almost instantly. Unintentional duplication of first or last names also sometimes occurs when characters from previously distinct works of fiction meet one another, or when fiction is in any way using individuals from Real Life, or in sprawling, shared-continuity settings like the DC or Marvel Comics universes.
It's probably more feasible to list the exceptions rather than examples. Usually when there are exceptions, there will be a storyline involving the characters being confused for each other. One possible way to avoid the issue, however, is for the characters with the same name to use different derivatives: James and Jimmy, Lizzy and Betty, Ted and Theo, etc.
One could only wish this were Truth in Television ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"], but as teachers know all too well, names go through cycles and depending on the era, a single class might have three Jasons, Michaels, Jennifers or Claras. Hence, this trope is generally considered an Acceptable Break from Reality.
It is an Enforced Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope"], however, within screen and stage acting. After a large number of mistaken identity incidents that caused actors to lose out on jobs to other actors with the same name or even where actors' careers were unjustifiably ruined because of a similaritynote  one such case was that of the actor William Boyd. He had been a up-and-coming matinee idol in the late silent era, and was part of the Production Posse for Cecil B Demille. However, there was another screen actor named William Boyd, usually credited as "William (Stage) Boyd" who had gotten in trouble with the law for alcohol possession and drunkenness (this was during Prohibition) among other things. The reports did not differentiate which Boyd was under arrest, and a number of national newspapers, assuming it was the more famous Boyd, ran his photo in the stories. RKO, who had is contract at the time, fired him on the grounds of the morals clause, even though he had not committed the acts alleged. This stalled his career, though he finally won fame as the portrayer of Hopalong Cassidy, most theatrical unions require or at least very strongly recommend that members joining who have a name of a pre-existing member change it to something else. For instance, "Stewart Granger", born James Stewart, who changed his name to avoide confusion with the James Stewart, or Michael J. Fox, who joined the union when veteran character actor Michael Fox was still active — Michael J added the "J" (which stands for nothing outside of a tribute to Michael J. Pollard, his real middle initial is "A") to differentiate.
This is also a problem in dubbing with "dubbed names". For example, Gomez Addams ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheAddamsFamily"] in Latin America is "Homero", just like Homer the Spider. Or a mobster named Bruno showing up in a Batman (who is known as "Bruno Díaz" instead of "Bruce Wayne") comic.
The antithesis is Planet of Steves ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfSteves"], wherein everybody is Steve.
Compare One-Mario Limit ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/OneMarioLimit"], where the "Steve" is too famous for anyone else to use a similar name. Contrast Inexplicably Identical Individuals, where there is a whole bunch of interchangeable characters that look the same and may share the same name—or have very similar names.
Also contrast Same Surname Means Related ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SameSurnameMeansRelated"], which removes the possibility that "Steve" and "Tom, Dick and Harry" having the same last name is just happenstance (even if/when they share one of the most common last names in whichever part of the world their franchise was produced). While on topic, characters from a same family will obviously share the same surname so it's not an aversion of this trope. However, related characters sharing a same first name do count: In Real Life, the practice of a child being named after a parent is not unheard of, and while you may often see a character with "Junior" in their name, or a Preppy Name such as "Charles Reginald III", you will rarely encounter said character's parents.
