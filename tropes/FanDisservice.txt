The Evil Twin ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin"] of Fanservice from another dimension, possibly with a goatee (especially if female). Fan Disservice looks like regular garden variety Fanservice, except that the creators intentionally use the circumstances around it to make the scene outright creepy, disgusting and/or just plain ridiculous. Corpses in sexy poses, dialogue that adds Mood Dissonance, seeing someone naked who you really wouldn't want to see naked... there's a hundred and one ways that titillation can transform into horror. Just think of how many Slasher Movies have Fanservice Extras meet their demise by way of Sex Signals Death.
Note that it often seems that film schools grind this into their students, as far too many movies intercut sex scenes with scenes of violence or squick ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick"], to truly rub in our faces the polarity of beauty and horror. Of course, the directors just want to be artists (that, or they're puritanical types who are obsessed with portraying sex in the most negative light possible). But sometimes it's implemented in a funny way, so the director can just mess with you.
Of course, Fan Disservice and Fanservice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice"] are not mutually exclusive. As Rule 36 states: If it exists, there's a fetish for it. Therefore, all Fan Disservice is considered Fanservice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice"] by somebody out there. Also, due to Troper Demographics, there are many examples linked elsewhere on the wiki which are listed as disservice solely because they involve naked men. Male nudity by itself is not Fan Disservice; there are demographics that male nudity tends to be Fanservice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice"] for. Some Drag Queens are often subject to this trope. (See also Unsettling Gender-Reveal.)
Also, it's pretty important to state that not all Fan Disservice is 100% tied into graphic squick. Context can also be vital into separating Fanservice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService"] from Fan Disservice; for example you can have a very gorgeous person in diverse states of undress and the visuals are technically pleasant to the eye, but the circumstances that led him or her to be like that can come from Break the Cutie, Break the Haughty, a Trauma Conga Line, No Yay, a horrendously Unequal Pairing, Rape as Drama, etc. Therefore, neither the most artistic and perfect drawing style nor the most tasteful angle shots can make this particular scene/shot enjoyable — you're too busy feeling sorry for the protagonist and/or desiring the perpetrator's head on a pike instead. Alternately, the character is an Ax-Crazy psycho launching a bloody Full-Frontal Assault. A gorgeous Mr./Ms. Fanservice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService"] with a particularly cruel personality is simultaneously Fan Disservice. Fan Disservice frequently overlaps with Nightmare Fuel and Nausea Fuel.
This trope can often overlap with Naked People Are Funny ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny"] — as often as not, naked people are funny precisely because of Fan Disservice. Can be paired with Psychosexual Horror.
Note: This trope is for sexy things deliberately placed in disturbing contexts that make them intentionally unsexy. Examples that are unintentional belong in Fetish Retardant ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetishRetardant"].
