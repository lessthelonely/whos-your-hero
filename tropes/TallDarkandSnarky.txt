This doesn't necessarily make them evil, though. (If anything, it's understandable, given the mindless ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouDumb"] way people often act around them.) They're just not a character who plays well with others and are therefore at risk of becoming an Ineffectual Loner. Their snarkiness is usually brought low not with sarcasm, but a good old Insult Backfire.
Often paired ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds"] or placed in contrast with an insufferably cheerful, outgoing, nice, and/or idealistic character, and may act as The Lancer. This character is usually responsible for teaching the Tall, Dark and Snarky about The Power of Friendship or The Power of Love, once he or she has enough skill to make the Tall, Dark and Snarky actually respect their opinion. However, this can backfire, with the Tall, Dark and Snarky feeling threatened by the character's newfound power and becoming The Rival instead or, worse, give the idealistic guy a pair of Jade-Colored Glasses to wear.
This archetype is also frequently used as a mentor or older brother type ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigBrother"], used as a foil for the protagonist's optimistic and foolish nature. They also are a common choice for a villain role as well. See also Tall, Dark, and Handsome for the straight vanilla versions, though a good-looking enough example of this trope may double as both.
