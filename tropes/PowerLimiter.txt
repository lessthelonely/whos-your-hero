A device of some kind used to restrict a character's power level ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels"] or super power.
These can lighten the load ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaPreservingHandicap"] on the Sorting Algorithm of Evil or give new characters a chance to shine. Releasing these limiters in time of need may be difficult:
The reasons for this can be because their powers are too dangerous ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfraidOfTheirOwnStrength"] or too uncontrollable to be let loose at their fullest all the time. A person may also willingly wear a Power Limiter as a form of training, as training with their power suppressed helps increase their power. Weighted clothing is often used in this fashion, in fiction and Real Life.
The upgraded version is the Power Nullifier ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier"], which outright removes superhuman abilities. This can sometimes be combined with Power Crutch (things that let them focus their power) especially for those with incontinence issues.
