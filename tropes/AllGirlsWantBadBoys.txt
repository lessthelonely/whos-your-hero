Maybe Hollywood is tapping into the ancestral female animal instinct to choose the mightiest, strongest, toughest genes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenPreferStrongMen"] for their offspring. Maybe it's just because Good Is Boring and Evil is Cool. Whatever the reason, in Hollywood, it's the bad boys the girls want.
The "bad boy" targets the strongest womanly instincts: the stoic, silent guy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne"] is a mystery waiting to be solved; the Troubled, but Cute youth with a tragic past is a woobie needing comfort; he's tough enough to be a girl's protector, but vulnerable enough to need her as well. Add to that the fact that bad guys are portrayed as sexier and skimpier than good guys, and the Anti-Hero ranks as Bachelor of the Month.
All this, of course, tends to gloss over the fact that bad boys are, well, ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself"] bad, meaning self-centered, possibly not too mentally stable, potentially abusive, might have trouble finding and keeping a legal job, and will most likely be more interested in the sexual aspect of a relationship than anything else. He's probably not going to be all that concerned with fidelity, either. So what if he only brings chaos into her life? It's an honor for girls in media to be chosen by him, to walk into prom night with him on her arm, to ride on the back of his motorcycle with her arms around his waist, to stick her tongue out at the Alpha Bitch from the passenger's seat of his stolen convertible.
Depending on the nature of the Bad Boy and whether he's redeemable or not, use of this trope may cause the viewer to question the character's sense or intelligence, particularly if it's immediately obvious to everyone from the outset of the relationship that the man is a thoroughly nasty piece of work. Don't count on Reformed Rakes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedRakes"] if the bad boy is a One-Shot Character. If the bad boy and/or the girl are unimportant characters, they have a tendency to be Straw Characters.
This portrayal can sometimes be the product of Entitled to Have You ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledToHaveYou"], Standard Hero Reward or Nice Guys Finish Last on the part of a good guy we're supposed to root for or the audience or the author. This bad boy is made to be a foil and show how "undesirable" the other options are. This can backfire if there are female audience members who have something else in mind. Ironically, their Fix Fic is likely to 1) make the bad boy look better and 2) make the nice guy look worse.
Sometimes the badness is an Informed Attribute ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute"], such as with the Lovable Rogue. It all depends on what the author wants to use this trope for. It's entirely possible for someone to look like a bad boy but not fit the above description. Sometimes a supposed bad boy who really isn't has to deal with the advances of a hyperactive Fangirl who doesn't know when to cut it out, resulting in comedy at the "bad boy's" expense.
Interestingly, younger women are often portrayed as prone to this trope, whereas older, more mature, and wiser women (meaning 35 and older) seem much less receptive to "bad boy" vibes (maybe they learnt their lesson through painful experience or are simply mature enough to know better), although there are always exceptions (especially bored housewives with marital issues). Can be portrayed as being either savvy or, if the bad boy falls into the not really a bad boy category (especially if he is a main character), an overly protective but well meaning mother figure ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouEverDoAnythingToHurtHer"] for the girl.
For really bad ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfJerk"] bad boys, the Girl (either intentionally or not) may find herself becoming a Monster Fangirl or a Love Martyr at worst. The girl may also go to the other end and find what they are looking for is the Nice Guy because Single Woman Seeks Good Manâ€”particularly as a Second Love, and often via Just Friends, when they've been burned by their previous boyfriend.
See Single Woman Seeks Good Man ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleWomanSeeksGoodMan"] for a typical inversion. Also see More Experienced Chases the Innocent, which frequently overlaps with the much more sexually promiscuous bad boy pursuing an inexperienced "good girl". A popular subversion is to make the guy look like a bad guy but reveal himself as a Jerk with a Heart of Gold with little to no criminal record.
Related to I Can Change My Beloved ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICanChangeMyBeloved"], which often follows after this, and Power Dynamics Kink. The fandom reaction version of this is Draco in Leather Pants. In high school settings, often found alongside All Guys Want Cheerleaders (its Spear Counterpart). A male Sexier Alter Ego will probably be one of these. When the bad boy is literally a monster, see You Sexy Beast. Contrast Endearingly Dorky and Weakness Turns Her On, where more timid, sweet, and "uncool" characters are seen as attractive. If the bad boy plays guitar, this will usually overlap with Artists Are Attractive. See Love Forgives All but Lust if the girl is willing to tolerate any wrongdoing on the bad boy's part except philandering.
Despite the gendered name, it can also be gender-inverted or applied to same-sex couples.
The inverse is Evil Desires Innocence ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilDesiresInnocence"].
Hybristophilia ["https://tvtropes.orghttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybristophilia"] is this trope taken to its Logical Extreme.
