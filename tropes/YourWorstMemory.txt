And then, no matter what they've done to suppress it, along comes something that makes them relive the moment.
This trope can occur in a number of different ways: on the simplest level, it can appear in the form of a dream ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastExperienceNightmare"], especially if the memory was traumatic enough; in more extreme cases, it can be brought back through magic, technology, or even an afterlife. In some cases, time travel may be involved. Whatever the case, the character is made to watch their worst memories play out all over again â€” and if they're unlucky, more than once. If they're really unlucky, forever.
For good measure, a not-uncommon twist to this trope involves someone else being invited along to this particular trip down memory lane, perhaps out of solidarity, maybe by mistake, or perhaps out of sheer sadism.
May involve a Journey to the Center of the Mind ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JourneyToTheCenterOfTheMind"], a Mind Probe, Mind Rape, a Mind Prison, a Black Bug Room, or a Psychological Torment Zone.
Compare and contrast My Greatest Failure ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure"], which may be a source of this trope, and Trauma Button, which can be inspired by examples of this.
