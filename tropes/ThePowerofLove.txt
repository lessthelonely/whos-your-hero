The Power of Love ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HueyLewisAndTheNews"] is a curious thing. It makes one man weep, and another man sing. It can change a hawk to a little white dove. Bring inanimate objects to life. It might just save your life. It makes people want to give up personal freedom to belong to each other. Don't you dare mock it, it's more than a feeling, that's the Power of Love.
Even more than The Power of Friendship ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship"] and The Power of Family, the Power of Love can be applied in dire situations to make things better. In fact, in many Disney movies it's the solution to everything. It's also an occasionally useful Deus ex Machina.
Common applications of the Power of Love include activating an Empathic Weapon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon"], freeing a loved one from mind control, strengthening a loved one, and converting a Real Death into a Disney Death. Even when the power of love is not literally and directly responsible, the scene is often set such that the audience is left with the impression that it was "really responsible". Although, Love is more powerful than magic as it usually helps break spells.
Don't You Dare Pity Me! ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe"] can sometimes be overcome by the Power Of Love; however, it may take time, and the love itself must be purified of any pity it does contain.
The Green-Eyed Monster ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster"] may come into play. In more idealistic shows, it is a sign of an immature love, where trust and faith is insufficient. However, more cynical shows may treat it as normal, and even let it overcome Cannot Spit It Out.
In cynical times, this can feel like a rip-off. It depends on where you, and the scene in question, fall on the Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism"].
Love Redeems ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems"] evil but it can also turn you evil. Combining the two, it can support said baddies.
Sometimes, love for someone who's threatened can give someone a Heroic Second Wind ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind"], especially a Mama Bear/Papa Wolf.
A more passive but no less impressive display of the Power of Love is its ability to use the Red String of Fate ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedStringOfFate"] to reunite the reincarnated lovers.
A Super-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTrope"] to Heart Beat-Down, True Love's Kiss, and Sexually Transmitted Superpowers. A Sister Trope to Light 'em Up (light based powers) and Holy Hand Grenade (holy powers) which are generally good. Compare Care-Bear Stare which includes all positive feelings (happiness, peace, love etc).
Compare and contrast with The Power of Lust ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLust"]. Contrast with The Power of Apathy and The Power of Hate. Occasionally classified as one of the Elemental Powers.
As seen with The Four Loves ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourLoves"], the word "love" can be used in several different ways, including for family, for friendship, or simply unconditional self-sacrifice just to do the right thing. However, this trope primarily refers to romantic love, partly because the English word "love" is taken to mean romantic in non-familial contexts.
