Though romance is important in many works, bonds of friendship between those of the same sex form some of fiction's most significant relationships. One common method of playing with these close relationships is to portray them similarly to romantic relationships, though the characters may feel nothing sexual for one another. For example, two male friends may bicker in an exaggerated manner ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeAnOldMarriedCouple"], mirroring how television normally depicts husbands and wives, or one friend may voice jealousy of another with lines lovers normally use.
The juxtaposition is often Played for Laughs ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs"], especially with male characters. Other such scenes may attempt fanservice, particularly when the characters are the opposite gender of the intended demographic. Rarer, the subtext is Played for Drama, using common romance tropes to heighten the strength of the relationship, although whether this means the writer supports interpretations that the relationship is romantic is usually left ambiguous.
In older media, when there were rules forbidding overt displays of homosexuality, writers who wanted to create gay characters would often resort to homosexual subtext.

This page covers only intentional examples, chiefly those lampshaded ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging"] by characters, Word of God, laughter or awkward pauses. It does not cover fans' delight at or tendency to view any interactions as gay; for that, see Ho Yay. It also does not cover any Ship Teases or actual homoerotism, where the characters may indeed be gay or bisexual for each other.
