Sometimes in comics or animated shows, a character is made to look like a particular actor or other celebrity whom the artist imagines playing the character. This might be out of admiration for the actor because the character fits with the actor's well-known roles, or in the hope that the actor would be flattered and try to get the comic adapted as a movie. Or it might be unconscious on the author/artist's part.
Fantasy casting can also occur in non-visual media such as (non-illustrated) novels but can be harder to spot unless Word of God ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod"] acknowledges it, or the character is closely based on a particular role the actor is associated with.
If the resemblance is outright stated in the text, it's Textual Celebrity Resemblance ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TextualCelebrityResemblance"]. For when the character is a direct impression or parody of a celebrity's public persona, see No Celebrities Were Harmed. For when an animated character is designed to resemble the real-world voice actor, see Ink-Suit Actor. See also Hypothetical Casting, for where creators do this as Word of God without making it explicit in canon.
Not the same thing as when a comic book or animation is spun-off from an earlier live-action film or TV show and the characters inevitably are drawn to look like the live-action actors, which would be "Reality Casting". However, sometimes there are borderline cases where a comic or animation is adapted into a live-action medium and artists start drawing a character to look like the actor in the adaptation ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcanon"].
