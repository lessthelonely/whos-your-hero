    <hero:tropeDescription>There are different kinds of irony. In verbal irony, the intended meaning of words is the opposite of the literal meaning of those words. In situational irony, the actual outcome of an action is the opposite of the intended effect (of that action). Basically, you'd think A, but in reality, what really happens is the opposite of A. See Analysis.Irony ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/Irony"] for other types of irony, but let's be clear on what irony is not, since that is where the confusion mainly comes from (and it's misused a lot). Irony can overlap with those, but just by themselves, they are not irony. This is where the confusion of the meaning of the word usually starts. People try to apply it where it doesn't belong ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/SquarePegRoundTrope"]. It's rather common in fiction for one person to correct another who has incorrectly used the term; see Dude, Not Ironic. It enjoyed a renaissance in the '90s ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties"] thanks to Postmodernism, which is a slightly different concept of irony. For tropes that are all about irony, see the Ironic Index ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicIndex"].</hero:tropeDescription>
