The Alternate Self is the same person as the character, but living a separate ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse"] life. The most common cause is that the two alternate selves live in separate ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse"] timelines that diverged reasonably recently and were the same or very similar during the person's formative years.
However, in some Speculative Fiction ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction"], a Alternate Self can also be created by a Teleporter Accident, a Time Travel mixup, where the clone somehow keeps the personality, skills and memories of the original.
The character and the alternate self (or the two alternate selves, if the plot treats them equally as characters) might have been more or less changed by different circumstances, but they are still the same person at the core. They may or may not be the same age, but they do NOT have a linear relationship of one being the younger self that will become the other — the older self.
Given the rise in popularity of The Multiverse ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse"] in popular fiction, especially in how it's often used to connect two previously unrelated pieces of fiction or separate adaptions in a Intra-Franchise Crossover, what exactly counts as an example of this trope can get confusing. This trope is when a specific piece of work features an alternate version of a character either through them meeting, the alternate self appearing in some form such as being The Cameo, or in an Alternate Reality Episode. While a specific work might connect to other adaptions that include the same characters, unless both versions of the character appear or are at least acknowledged to some extent in the same work the trope should not be used.
An Alternate Self is the opposite of a Mirror Self ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorSelf"], and yet they often overlap in a fluid pondering of identity.
In the case of separate timelines, the two alternate selves may or may not be able to share information through Flash Sideways ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashSideways"].
When several alternate selves team up against something or someone, it's an Alliance of Alternates ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllianceOfAlternates"]. The appearance of an alternate may result in Doppelgänger Gets Same Sentiment or Alternate Personality Punishment. If the alternate self goes by a different name, see Alternative-Self Name-Change.
