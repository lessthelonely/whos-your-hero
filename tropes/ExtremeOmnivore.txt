The Extreme Omnivore will eat just about anything out of hunger or curiosity, so long as it looks like food. And sometimes even when it clearly doesn't ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasochistsMeal"]. They don't fear the Lethal Chef, and you will never hear them say I Ate WHAT?!
There are two versions of this trope:
Both versions may also be open to the idea of cannibalism ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian"] when the opportunity presents itself.
Please note that instances of someone being forced to eat something disgusting or inappropriate isn't Extreme Omnivorosity. Likewise for unintentional ingestion ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAteWhat"]. A true Extreme Omnivore has a long-term pattern of eating everything knowingly, willingly, and usually cheerfully.
Compare Paste Eater ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PasteEater"]. Horde of Alien Locusts can be an entire species of this. Extreme Omni-Goat is a subtrope where this applies to goats. A character like this is likely to be a Big Eater, though a Big Eater generally restricts themselves to things ordinarily considered food. Compare Extreme Omnisexual. Contrast Picky Eater and Unconventional Food Usage. Compare Fantastic Diet Requirement; while the Extreme Omnivore can eat almost anything, but doesn't typically require any one specific intake, someone with a Fantastic Diet Requirement needs to eat something unusual, usually a single specific thing, either exclusively or as part of their diet.
Don't Try This at Home ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome"], seriously. People have died trying to eat things not meant for human consumption. At best, you'll feel sick to your stomach. At worst, you'll die because of it.
