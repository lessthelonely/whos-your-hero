In a series with more than one Anti-Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero"] and Anti-Villain, it can be hard to tell who's good and who's bad. Things can become even more mucked up when someone clearly switches sides.
If this is the case, it's a Hazy Feel Turn.
This is when someone doesn't waver from black ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn"] to white and back, but from gray to grey. We know the position's changed, but how so? Is he good or evil? Gone from good to a different kind of good? It's hard to tell because everyone in the piece wavers.
To be clear, the characters and readers know which side the turner is on (or at least which party he joined). It's about the readers not knowing if his turn was towards good or towards bad because they don't know if the party he joined is good or bad. The other characters in the show will usually describe it as a Heel–Face Turn ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn"] if he joined their group and as a Face–Heel Turn if he joined their enemies because most people will consider their own group the good side and the other side(s) as bad. In such cases, a character's true moral compass alignment is generally revealed more by the motive and means of their defection than by the act of defecting itself.
Keep in mind that this trope is about a change of sides, not about characters. It's not enough for a character to have an ambiguous alignment, he must also actively change sides from one ambiguous group to another (or from one good/bad group to another, as long as you can't tell which one of the two is better).
Often revealed to be a Face–Heel Turn ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn"] or a Heel–Face Turn as people's motivations become better revealed. Often done by an Enigmatic Minion, Ensemble Dark Horse, or a Wild Card.
Not to be confused with Heel–Face Revolving Door ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor"], where a character frequently switches sides in a Black-and-White Morality setting.
