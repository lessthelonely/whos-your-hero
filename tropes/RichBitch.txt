Snide, contemptuous, and ever-so-superior to coworkers or neighbors, the Rich Bitch is the character you love to hate. She has social position and/or money and never lets anyone around her forget it, and if she can make you feel like dirt, she'll do it just to amuse herself ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe"]. She can be especially vicious to suitors pursuing her who are not up to her sometimes impossible standards. Too much money has made her a bitch. If there is a Country Mouse in the cast, she usually reserves the worst of her abuse for them, especially if the Country Mouse is another female.
The Rich Bitch is what the Alpha Bitch ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch"] and the Spoiled Brat often become when they grow up, and their motto is "Screw the Rules, I Have Money!."
If the Rich Bitch has an Attack Animal ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAnimal"], or the story focuses on animals (be they Talking Animals or Funny Animals), then 9 times out of 10, this character will be a Psycho Poodle as a Right-Hand Attack Dog.
A Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] of Idle Rich and The Upper Crass. See Upper-Class Twit for the usual Spear Counterpart. Despite this, male examples, Rich Bastards, do exist.
Compare Gold Digger ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger"], Grande Dame, and Bitch in Sheep's Clothing. Contrast Spoiled Sweet, Uncle Pennybags, Mock Millionaire, and The Ojou.
Rich bitches do exist in real life ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"], but it's best that we don't list any real life examples here..
