Some fighters have speed ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster"], some have strength. Proponents of Confusion Fu have unpredictability.
Their attacks and motions are random (or seem to be), making them difficult to read and predict. Perhaps their priorities and motivations are so different from your own that attempting to guess their next move doesn't work, or perhaps their bodies are structured in such an unfamiliar way that you do not recognize the movements that foretell a particular action.

Compare Improv Fu. Contrast Strategy, Schmategy, where the randomness is unintentional. Not to be confused with What the Fu Are You Doing?, where the fighting style doesn't work because the fighter is incompetent at it.
