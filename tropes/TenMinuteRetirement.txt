In the middle of a crisis, calamity, or sheer unadulterated apocalypse, something terrible happens (but not, typically, any more terrible than happens in any given episode) and The Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero"] completely and utterly gives up. Common lines that go with the phenomenon are "I'm too old for this," "I can't do it," "There is nothing I can do," "The best thing to do is to get out of here," or "Somebody else can." May even be the follow-up to a Heroic BSoD or Villainous BSoD, which is similar but involuntary.
After some kind of epiphany, often accompanied by a "No More Holding Back" Speech ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMoreHoldingBackSpeech"], the character comes out of retirement and announces that they are back on the job, typically followed by the show's equivalent of a Foe-Tossing Charge â€” anything from actual foe-tossing to kicking butt in the school spelling bee. (See also Look What I Can Do Now!, which is similar but involves a character leaving and returning much badder than before.)
It's also a common Romantic Comedy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticComedy"] trope to have one of the principal couple suddenly decide to quit working with or for the other, vowing to never come back, only to return a few scenes later.

Opposite of Passing the Torch, where The Hero seriously hands on the responsibility to someone else. He's Back! is what happens when the character returns to action. Breaking the Fellowship is the equivalent for a whole group rather than a mere individual.
