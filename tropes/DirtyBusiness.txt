Sometimes, you do what needs doing ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo"], but that doesn't mean you have to like it.
The Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero"] does something wrong, or ambiguous, or involving some sacrifice. They feel tainted by it, even if they had no choice in the matter. This is one way to humanize them and show that they are not just cold and heartless, thus making them more palatable to viewers. Sometimes the display of remorse might even avert a crossing of the Moral Event Horizon.
There is no need for them to resolve to act otherwise, or wish that they had acted otherwise, to bring this trope into play; merely wishing that it had not been necessary is enough. They can wish that they were not praised as much for it, in the Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] Be All My Sins Remembered.
They can even think that it is Dirty Business while they decide to do it, feeling stuck between a rock and a hard place. Often due to Conflicting Loyalty ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictingLoyalty"], they would feel the same way about either choice. When the hero does wish they had not done it, see My God, What Have I Done? and Tears of Remorse.
The better sort of Knight Templar ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar"] or Well-Intentioned Extremist may also feel it, though generally overlapping with a willful blindness to the fact that it did not, in fact, have to be done. A somewhat nastier version may claim that their suffering, having to do these things, is the important thing, and completely ignore their victims' sufferings.
How wrong the act is depends on the Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism"], and the character. Those with Incorruptible Pure Pureness may feel it for even ambiguous acts, while an Anti-Hero or Anti-Villain may reserve it for serious wrongdoing. Sometimes a character suffers Curious Qualms of Conscience when they can't figure out why they think that act was Dirty Business.
May manifest as Past Experience Nightmare ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastExperienceNightmare"], Beard of Sorrow, Drowning My Sorrows and the like, but does not need to be severe enough to reach that level. In some cases, may result in them becoming The Atoner.
See also Shoot the Dog ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog"], which often provokes this in the better characters â€” and shows that the worse characters are worse by their lack of this.
Trope also blends well with Realpolitik ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Realpolitik"] and even Treachery Cover Up.
Has nothing to do with ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant"] "doing one's business", or with actually dirty businesses, be that the TV show or any such jobs themselves.
Reminder: This is not just about doing morally ambiguous things! The character must also show remorse for it. If there is no mention of showing remorse for the deed, please consider another, more appropriate trope like Shoot the Dog ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog"].
