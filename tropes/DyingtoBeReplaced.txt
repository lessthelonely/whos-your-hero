Well, then. We'll just have to do something about that ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlotReaper"], won't we?
Contrast You Kill It, You Bought It ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt"] when a character in-story, instead of a writer, kills another character to take on his job or MacGuffin.
This trope is similar to Mentor Occupational Hazard ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorOccupationalHazard"] from an in-setting standpoint, but differs significantly as a trope in that such a mentor exists only to die so the hero can replace them; victims of this trope, on the other hand, are always established characters in their own right.
May invoke Take Up My Sword ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeUpMySword"]. If the character's been absent for a while, they might have to be brought Back for the Dead (or just suffer a Bus Crash).
Beware: This is an easy way to create a Replacement Scrappy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy"] in some fans' eyes.
