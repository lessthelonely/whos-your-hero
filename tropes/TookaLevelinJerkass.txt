When a character grows into a Jerkass ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass"] over time (sometimes rather quickly). Can be due to Flanderization, a Faceâ€“Heel Turn, a traumatic incident, or just another regular albeit unfortunate case of Character Development, which depends on who's writing said character(s). While a Jerkass ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass"] growing into a Jerk with a Heart of Gold is a common phenomenon, especially in dramas, a reversal, resulting in this trope, is also common, especially in comedies.
This can also cause tropes like What the Hell, Hero? ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero"], though whether the character changes back to their kind-hearted ways, again, it usually depends on the writer. If the transition is shown as a flashback regarding a known jerk/villain, it may be a Start of Darkness.
