The chaste twin ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope"] of Hotter and Sexier, when something is Tone Shifted to be far less sexual and vulgar than an earlier incarnation or installment.
Possible reasons for this shift in tone include the creators thinking of the censors ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheCensors"], wanting a bigger audience for their material, or the former sexual content being an Old Shame.
One tool creators might use to achieve this includes the Digital Bikini ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalBikini"], especially in anime works.
Also related to Bowdlerise ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise"], which is about editing questionable or offensive content from a work; and Lighter and Softer, especially when the work opens itself up for children.
Related to Lighter and Softer ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter"] and Adaptational Modesty. Compare and contrast Younger and Hipper. See also Tone Shift.
Not to Be Confused with ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/NotToBeConfusedWith"] Bleached Underpants, where a creator's works become tamer and chaster over the course of a career. This trope refers only to changes within a single work or franchise.
