This character starts out experienced. They have finished training, have attained most of their power, and made a name for themselves. The audience may only learn of their Back Story ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory"] in a prequel, short flashback, or a brief mention, if they learn any backstory at all.
On the low-experience end of comparisons for this trope, we have From Zero to Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromZeroToHero"], Ordinary High-School Student and Farm Boy, who are complete novices, Rookie Red Ranger who is a novice compared to the others on his team, and Child Prodigy and Skilled, but Naive protagonists, who are young and inexperienced but are quick learners. A highly experienced supporting character would be The Mentor, who is experienced and skilled but only tasked in the story with teaching a protagonist, rather then being one themselves.
