For some men, it's very easy to forget what they are doing when a sexy body ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadTurningBeauty"] strolls past and lose control, doing things like walking into walls, tripping over themselves, dropping fragile objects, causing a Human Traffic Jam, etc. Mostly a comedy trope.
If this is induced intentionally by the seducer in question when We Need a Distraction ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeNeedADistraction"], it falls instead into Show Some Leg.
Compare Chic and Awe ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChicAndAwe"], Sex Sells, Sexy Coat Flashing, and Show Some Leg. Contrast, naturally, Not Distracted by the Sexy, Ignore the Fanservice, and The Power of Lust (which is when the sexy inspires rather than distracts). This may occur after a Crash Through the Harem.
If the viewers are the ones Distracted By The Sexy, that's Best Known for the Fanservice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestKnownForTheFanservice"]. If the distracted party finds himself lost in thought over the distraction, it becomes Eating the Eye Candy. If distracted by someone that their orientation wouldn't generally be attracted to, that's Stupid Sexy Flanders. If communication is attempted, it can cause Gibberish of Love. Expect Favors for the Sexy by the distracted. If a character distracts themselves by noticing their reflection in a mirror, that's Distracted by My Own Sexy. See Cuteness Proximity for the non-sexy, non-human variant. Compare also with Screw the Rules, I'm Beautiful!
