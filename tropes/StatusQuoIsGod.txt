Within a work, particularly long-running series and franchises, almost nothing changes. If something does change, it's generally reset back to the way it was before very quickly.
This usually happens in a series with no overarching conflict or plot, although it is also the final stage of Exponential Plot Delay ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExponentialPlotDelay"], the phenomenon in which the plot of a serial story has totally ground to a halt. In either case, each installment of the series will open under virtually identical circumstances to the installment that came before.
Why create a static situation? The creators want the audience to be familiar with the characters and situation, without having to bother with such things as "what happened last episode".
This trope is especially true for cartoons, where networks want to be free to broadcast reruns in any convenient order or lack thereof. It's also very common in sitcoms and comics, and as a result, there is a lot of Aesop Amnesia ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia"] created. Although characters have learned their lessons or attempted to improve their predicaments, nothing ever really changes.
While this trope can be used to help avoid Continuity Lockout ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockout"], it also can be very difficult to juggle an unchanging status quo without gradually turning off your audience; characters and situations which never change tend to get stale after a while, and audiences can get a bit tired of seeing the Reset Button being pushed every time it looks like something might happen to change things.
Status Quo Is God can easily collide with Happily Ever After ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter"]. Sometimes, a story simply can't have an ending that is both happy and maintains the status quo—thus, these two powerful tropes are in conflict with each other. When this conflict occurs, it's likely that the status quo will be maintained, and the ending will be less happy than it might have been if not for Status Quo Is God. For example, if a main character gains a significant other at the beginning of the episode, it is almost certain that they will break up by the end, for one reason or another. (On the other hand, if the entire series is due to end and the creators feel confident that they'll never do a sequel, they may decide to break this trope with a Grand Finale that permanently fixes everything.)
Status Quo Is God is usually the justification for a Yo Yo Plot Point ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoYoPlotPoint"] or an Ageless Birthday Episode. It has nothing to do with the divinity of a certain rock band, however.
Negative Continuity ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity"] is what happens when this trope is exaggerated—not only does nothing ever change, it doesn't even require an explanation In-Universe, the world just resets at the end of every episode. See also, Alternate Universe Reed Richards Is Awesome, in which characters get a glimpse of an alternative universe where things have, in fact, changed.
Related to Just Eat Gilligan ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatGilligan"] and Un-Confession. Unlikely Spare may also be used to this effect. For the opposite, in which a work changes dramatically over the course of its run, see Nothing Is the Same Anymore.
