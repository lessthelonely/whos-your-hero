A Super Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero"] who does not actually have a hero name, despite maintaining a generally low-profile Secret Identity. These heroes are simply called by their "real" names in the heat of battle.
This is not a character using a family or given name that is snazzy (or not ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingMiddleName"]) as their heroic name (for example, former surgeon Stephen Strange continuing to go by "Doctor Strange"). Compare Steven Ulysses Perhero, where the Meaningful Name has something to do with the character's powers.
Normally justified with their real name being common and their civilian identity being fairly nondescript, but not always. Or maybe they simply don't see a reason to bother with a secret identity (maybe their family is capable of protecting themselves from villain attacks ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFamily"], maybe they look so different as heroes that no one recognizes their civilian identity, maybe they lost everyone they love and don't have anyone left to protect, etc.)
It might backfire ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope"] on them if a villain decides to learn more about them and targets their close friends and family, showing exactly why many heroes bother with a Secret Identity.
Compare Overt Operative ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertOperative"], a secret agent who never bothers keeping low. Contrast Real Name as an Alias.
