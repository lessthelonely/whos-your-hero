Time in comics is flexible. Each panel shows a single event, which is usually accompanied by a length of dialog, which must take some time to say. This disparity is usually accepted if it isn't taken to extremes.
But often, characters will exposit ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exposition"] when it's most needed: at the story's climax, when both the intricacies of the plot and the intensity of action hit their highest.
While the heroes Outrun the Fireball ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutrunTheFireball"], Mr. Exposition might explain why the Evil Overlord's death caused the explosion. The Action Girl can deliver impressive lectures on why the monster's Achilles' Heel will work, while still engaging in Waif-Fu. The Superhero can quip to his heart's content and explain his abilities while dueling one insignificant mobster, or deliver a Kirk Summation during the course of a single Finishing Move. Sometimes, even mere mortals can give a lecture on what is happening when it would be a much better idea to simply run like hell.
This trope is mostly found in comics and similar non-audio visual media: Comic Books ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBooks"], Newspaper Comics, Manga, and Web Comics. It's become less common in the era of Decompressed Comics, possibly because it was taken to silly degrees at times, but it has never really gone away.
If a comic is translated into a medium where time is a factor, the trope can become obvious ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InactionSequence"]. This is particularly common with anime adaptations of manga, where the action — or even time itself — might stop in the middle of the action just so that the hero can deliver a speech of some sort.
Another variant can occur in roleplaying video games, where battle can stop for dialogue scenes, either for Character Development ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment"] or rules description. Enemies will often be present, but they'll hold off on attacking for this purpose.
The Trope Namer is Dungeons & Dragons ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons"], in which certain actions (most notably talking) are designated "free actions" and can be taken in addition to any other actions within the normal limit of a turn. A turn in D&D is said to take six seconds in-universe; being restricted to only what a player could say in six seconds wouldn't allow any time for planning, strategizing, or just calling out what you're going to do. Talking does not distract the player from any other actions, and there is no word count limit on how much the player can say. This is a case of Rule of Fun and Acceptable Breaks from Reality; spouting a Bond One-Liner during combat is awesome, but no one would do it when it would impair combat performance.
Compare Inaction Sequence ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InactionSequence"], Comic-Book Time, Webcomic Time, Expolabel, Wall of Text, Changing Clothes Is a Free Action, and Transformation Is a Free Action. Talk to the Fist is this trope's feared enemy, Killed Mid-Sentence is its biggest subversion, and Exposition Beam can bypass it. Where it's exaggerated, the audience may tend to start wondering Why Don't You Just Shoot Him? Contrast Distracting Disambiguation, where there is some amount of cooperation on the enemies' part that enables this, and Holding the Floor, where a character talks to deliberately buy time.
