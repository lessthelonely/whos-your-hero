In the endless rounds of My Kung-Fu Is Stronger Than Yours ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyKungFuIsStrongerThanYours"], there will eventually come a time when one's self-directed training (or lack thereof) will no longer prove sufficient to the task. The character must then find a mentor who will help him tap into his inner strength and develop new and more powerful attacks. This invariably requires multiple rounds of Training from Hell, or a difficult quest (which is the same thing disguised as a trip).
This is the usual manner in which a character will learn how to perform Ki Manipulation ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation"].
Sometimes done in a flashback to surprise the viewer.
Compare So Last Season ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason"] and Super-Empowering. See also Full-Potential Upgrade when a character's weapons or tools have to be powered-up along with the character. For their first fight afterwards see Look What I Can Do Now!
