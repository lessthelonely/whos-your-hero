    <hero:tropeDescription>A character encounters an "alternate" version of themselves that they greatly dislike. The alternate can be a work of fiction ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrapThereAreFanficsOfUs"] existing only on a written page or Show Within a Show, or a Doppelg√§nger of some sort (Clone, Reincarnation, Time Travel, Alternate Universe, etc). The alternate version may be a thinly veiled caricature that exaggerates negative qualities or emphasizes neutral or even positive traits in ways the original dislikes, or invents traits whole cloth that are highly out of character. Or maybe they're just Too Much Alike. The original is likely to become very angry at the author or the alternate for the real (or perceived) insult. The "original" may find that For Want Of A Nail ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail"] their alternate version is really annoying, and (if not a fictional creation) the alternate may likewise find the original embarrassing. On the other hand, the alternate may be a much more successful or well developed individual who angers the original by outshining them. Expect at least one of them to say "I Resemble That Remark!", "Do I Really Sound Like That?" and/or "Why didn't anyone tell me this makes me look fat?" Can result in Hypocritical Humor if they're annoyed at a fault their other self possesses, unaware they have that flaw themselves. Compare Future Me Scares Me ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe"], Evil Me Scares Me and I Hate Past Me. Often is a key plot element in Meet Your Early-Installment Weirdness.</hero:tropeDescription>
