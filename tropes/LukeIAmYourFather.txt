A parent-child relationship between two characters who were previously thought unrelated is revealed, usually with generous dollops of melodrama—blood is, after all, Thicker Than Water ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater"]. Beloved of soap operas, made famous by the Star Wars films (from which the trope takes its name, though as you can see, it isn't an exact quote).
Whether or not this is a good thing or a bad thing for whoever is being given the reveal mainly depends on who is giving the reveal in question. Sometimes an ally, a Mentor ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mentors"] or a non-romantic Mysterious Protector will turn out to be the parent of the person being given the reveal, but other times, the reveal of who a character's parent is will be cause for serious anguish, such as someone who just gave his or her life for him, someone who could have been a Love Interest, or worst of all, a villain (maybe even the Big Bad) as in the most infamous Star Wars example.
In cases when villain and hero turn out to be parent and child, count on at least one scene where the hero worries that they will eventually end up like the parent ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousLineage"].
Sometimes it's a bogus revelation, and at the end of the episode or plotline the Reset Button ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton"] is pressed to restore the previous relationship — or lack of one.
Though the trope itself is too fundamental ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadHorseTrope"] to become Discredited, any permutation of the actual line ("No, X. I am your father.") nowadays will be met with a groan and a "Not again!" from the audience. Also a popular insane fan theory.
Compare with Mysterious Parent ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousParent"], or Family Relationship Switcheroo where the characters were thought to be related, but are not parent and child. Frequently, it's a father-son relationship revealed this way.
This trope was already being mocked back in 1790 by Jane Austen ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten"] in Love and Freindship (with four grandfather-grandchildren relationships revealed in under a page).
This is a specific variety of The Reveal ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal"]. The flip-side is Luke, You Are My Father. Compare Long-Lost Relative, Luke, I Might Be Your Father, Everyone Is Related. Contrast with I Am Not Your Father and Mistaken for Related. Sub-Trope of Connected All Along. Frequently occurs alongside Archnemesis Dad.
The subversion is Refused Reunion ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefusedReunion"] where the character, after being discovered and confronted by their offspring, denies parentage.
Here is a compilation ["https://tvtropes.orghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VJszzqbUuk"] with a lot of examples of this trope.
Not to be confused with My Real Daddy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRealDaddy"], which is when fans reject the interpretation of the work by who is technically the original creator, in favor of someone else's superior interpretation. Also not to be confused with True Ancestor, a term for a powerful first-generation vampire or demon.
