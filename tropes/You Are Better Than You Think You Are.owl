    <hero:tropeDescription>Some characters are Older Than They Look ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook"] (much older, even). Some, meanwhile, are younger. Maybe they're robots, clones, some other kind of artificial construct, or just unhealthy. Maybe there's a supernatural reason, such as a curse. Or maybe they are under such constant stress and work that they are aged prematurely by it. Or they're just overdeveloped. One way or another, this character may look like an adult(/teenager/pre-teen), and even act and talk like one, but chronologically speaking, they aren't. Other times there may be a young adult with the appearance of a middle aged or even older man/woman. Gray hair ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrematurelyGreyHaired"], a prematurely receding hairline, generally cause someone to look older. Certain types of facial hair also can make a younger man seem older. Subtropes include Older Alter Ego ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAlterEgo"], a magical ability for younger kids to temporarily turn into adults and back, and Plot-Relevant Age-Up, the same permanently. Similar, but not to be confused with Artistic Age ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticAge"], where this is due to art rather than in-story causes. If, in live-action, their age is surprising to the viewer but not anyone in story, it's a bad side-effect of Dawson Casting. Super-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTrope"] to Born as an Adult, Really Was Born Yesterday. Compare Compulsory School Age, Mistaken Age, Age-Inappropriate Dress. Contrast Animation Anatomy Aging. See also Really 17 Years Old (where someone is younger than they claim to be).</hero:tropeDescription>
