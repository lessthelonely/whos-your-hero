We all know that in an Alternate History ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory"] or Alternate Universe, tiny changes ("For want of a nail, the shoe was lost...") can lead to massive changes, where everything is different.
Or, as it may be, not. Sometimes what's different in the new history is less interesting than what has stayed exactly the same.
Consider how a person's DNA is the result of an ovum and one of countless spermatozoa competing to get at it. The slightest change in timing by seconds would result in a completely different person; different sex, possibly different personality and different abilities, etc. (i.e., half the difference between fraternal twins). This is hardly ever addressed.
An alternate universe could arise where the human race never developed money and society is radically different, but you'll find that you were still born, still live in the same house, and still have that tattered old E.T. ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraTerrestrial"] doll sitting on the mantlepiece.
In an ongoing series, there's generally an element of the production team wanting to get the most out of actors and sets that they've already paid for. In both series and standalone works, the writer may be trying to draw interesting parallels between two different versions of the same character or situation, or to help impress upon the reader how things are different by showing them a familiar figure in slightly different circumstances; Richard Nixon, the Used Car Salesman ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichardNixonTheUsedCarSalesman"] allows the reader to see how the world is different, rather than Richard Nixon The Person Who Never Existed Because A Different Spermatozo√∂n Fertilized His Mother's Egg.
If the new history is the result of Time Travel ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel"], it might be possible to explain the non-changes as reality avoiding a Temporal Paradox (by making sure that there's still a time machine and a time traveller to go back and create the new history). Often it isn't. And even when it is, the writer usually doesn't bother. The other possible explanation could be that there is some form of higher power (like God, for example) preventing the timeline from changing too drastically. Another still would be the idea of chaos theory and the butterfly effect as being unpredictable in relation to its consequences. As the saying goes, the more things change, the more they stay the same.
If it's not the result of time travel, it could be explained by the alternative universes being "parallel", which is often presented as something universes would be naturally expected to do, although this doesn't really explain anything. Some more specific tropes like Bizarro Universe ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroUniverse"] and Gender-Bent Alternate Universe work by having things being much the same in spite of also being completely different in some respect. Parallel universes just seem to be compelled to follow similar paths.
Naturally, this could result in a Close-Enough Timeline ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseEnoughTimeline"].
(Note that this doesn't really apply to alternate histories where the change was something the protagonists or their parents did or didn't do. You wouldn't expect universal change within one generation.)
Of course, why does Hitler have to be the only detail history refused to change ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlersTimeTravelExemptionAct"]?
In fanfiction, this is often a result of The Stations of the Canon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon"], where a fanfic still has many of the same relationships, events, and setpieces happen even when the rest of the story should be well off-track, especially in a Peggy Sue fic. For instance, a story where the protagonist ends up being given a massive powerboost might still have villains throwing the same challenges at them, even when they know they should easily defeat them.
See Mirror Character ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorCharacter"], which this is likely to result in. Compare Ontological Inertia. Could also be a result of You Can't Fight Fate. If we're expected to believe things "just happen" to be the same, a subtrope of Contrived Coincidence.
