For most characters, killing people is not something they do on a regular basis. For an Affably Evil ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil"] Big Bad who believes Utopia Justifies the Means or an Action Hero on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge, killing a few mooks or Red Shirts just comes with the job. Cops and spies might need to pull the trigger occasionally, but this aspect is not the prime focus of their work. But for a Professional Killer, it is the work. Whether you call him an assassin, a hitman, a contract killer, or a hired gun, it means the same. Killing is his job.
While soldiers, mercenaries, Private Military Contractors ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors"], snipers, or professional terrorists typically have to kill someone to accomplish their mission, that mission typically involves something other than just killing â€” protecting a VIP, destroying or capturing an objective, spreading fear amongst the local population, etc. A Professional Killer's job typically is to kill one specific person and nothing else.
A wide range of colorful characters can become drawn to the trade of killing for cash. Some might be Wicked Cultured ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured"] and tend to wear nice suits. Others might be psychotic killers who are more drawn to the carnage and combat than the money. Some might be Punch Clock Villains who pull shifts at Murder, Inc. or belong to a Weird Trade Union to pay the bills. They might be a Consummate Professional or a snarky jerk. A Hitman with a Heart might follow a code of honor, such as not harming women, children or innocents. Sometimes, they might be raised from birth just for killing marks, or even one mark, in their entire life. If they live in the past, they might be a Ninja or a Hashshashin. Whatever their style or personality, their employers are typically only interested in the results.
See Assassin Outclassin' ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssassinOutclassin"] for when the Professional Killer fails drastically, Murder, Inc. for when a group of professional killers form a guild, and Assassination Sidequest for a type of sidequest that requires you to kill a specific target stealthily. If whoever hired the hitman decides to try to get rid of him, you have a Contract on the Hitman.
If a contract is open to whoever accomplishes the hit first, then they're also Bounty Hunters ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter"]; although some bounties require live delivery, and are not this trope. There's also The Executioner, another kind of professional who kills people for a living, though they typically dispatch victims who've already been captured instead of seeking them out as assassins do.
If this character happens to be a prostitute, she's a Shady Lady of the Night ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadyLadyOfTheNight"].
