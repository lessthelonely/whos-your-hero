On the bright side, though, he almost always has a deep sense of decency—typically what gets him involved in the plot in the first place—often alloyed with a level of persistence that borders on inappropriate. He will try to help people, and keep helping long after everyone else has given up on them. In anime, especially, this can make him a Clueless Chick-Magnet ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessChickMagnet"], which is why he's a staple in Bishoujo Series, especially love/harem comedies. Although you could argue that anybody who's the focus of a harem is the opposite of unlucky.
The depth of his flaws varies wildly from series to series, and being an Audience Surrogate ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate"], how likeable he is often depends on his chemistry with the other characters. In a Magical Girlfriend series, his personality tends to be more moderate since he'll inevitably get together with the lead. But in a Harem Series, his haplessness makes him appealingly harmless to the girls. He will also fill any basic role they project on him. His inexperience with girls is a constant source of humor, but since they usually won't have much experience with guys either (save the Hard-Drinking Party Girl, who finds him a source of amusement), the awkwardness is mutual.
His parents will not be around, for whatever reason ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment"]; more distant relatives may be featured. If he has siblings, it will be a cute little sister or sexy big sister.
His design should ideally be muted to a basic outfit and a realistic hair color, although he'll sometimes be a Bishōnen ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen"] simply due to being drawn in an appealing artstyle.
A poorly done case will result in Marty Stu ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyStu"]—his only flaws are informed ones and he fixes other people's problems easily.
Compare: The Everyman ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman"]. See also: the female counterpart to Unlucky Everydude, the Naďve Everygirl. If this character is gay, he is likely to be a Twink. No connection to The Dude.
