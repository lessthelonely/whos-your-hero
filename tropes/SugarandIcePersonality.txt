A character with a Sugar-and-Ice Personality has two distinct sides, one cold and distant, the other warmer and more open. In some cases, the differences between the two aspects of the character's personality are so radical as to be shocking coming from the same person. Often this extreme polarity is due to some form of traumatic experience ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird"] or social awkwardness, though occasionally it might resemble a full-blown Split Personality or one-man Red Oni, Blue Oni or Good Cop/Bad Cop. Their dual nature could also simply be the way they are, with no explanation otherwise given.
The cold side can have a few different variants, though the Ice Queen or Ice King ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen"] is probably the most common, mixing aloofness and distance with a certain harshness and lack of sympathy. Another manifestation of this side is as The Stoic, being simply unemotional and unresponsive rather than harsh. Occasionally this could be part of their personality may resemble a full-on Emotionless Girl, or include the sharp-tongued aspects of The Snark Knight.
The warm side, on the other hand, is usually quite kind, open, and emotive. Some variations can be very animated when in the right situation, though others may be Shrinking Violets ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet"], uncertain how to interact with others when not acting tough. Even the shy-types, however, usually wear at least a small smile or sport a Luminescent Blush to indicate that they are far more emotionally reactive than their cold side.
Usually, their cold side is the one everyone is used to, with the warmer side only glimpsed in response to specific triggers. In many cases, all it takes is getting to know the person before the warm side begins to make an appearance ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen"].
More rarely, the frosty side is the seldom-seen aspect and is only evoked when they are confronted by something they find annoying or tedious. Often this is a bumbling Love Interest ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest"] who doesn't know what he's done wrong. While there are occasions where the cold side is a mask, this by no means describes all examples. In such cases both sides are genuine aspects of their personality, the character is simply compartmentalized to a much greater degree than most people are.
Compare Not So Stoic ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic"] and Stoic Woobie. Sometimes related to Beneath the Mask. A Sister Trope to Tsundere (which is basically "Sugar and Fire"). Anime fandom refers to this character as a kuudere (a portmanteau of kuuru, "cool" in Engrish, and deredere, "lovestruck"). Rei Ayanami Expy is a specific subtrope with a particular set of characteristics. In Myersâ€“Briggs and in a Four-Temperament Ensemble, this is a typical trait of I_T_ and the Melancholic, respectively, though occasionally it can apply to the other types and temperaments. Not to be confused with An Ice Person, though sometimes they overlap.
