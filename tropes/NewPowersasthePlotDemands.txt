Some authors seem to get bored of the same old powers. They add new ones to the same characters whenever they feel that a new power would open up a new story, or a new danger needs a new response, or just to spice things up.
Sometimes a retcon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon"], a power upgrade, or some bit of Phlebotinum is employed to explain the new power, but other times the character does some fantastic feat they've never done before; when their friends say, "I didn't know you could do that!", they come back with either "I've never needed to, till now," or "Neither did I!"
This kind of plot point is no big deal early in a story — a character who has only recently been empowered is fully justified ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope"] in not knowing what they can do. Likewise, "neither did I until now" in an experienced character can be reasonable, if it's happening in some circumstance or special condition that the character has never encountered before. This trope generally applies when it's a steady parade of new powers that just keeps marching on.
If the plot was crafted to fit the powers (as opposed to the powers changing to meet the needs of the plot) you have a Plot Tailored to the Party ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTailoredToTheParty"] or a job for Aquaman. When the new ability is something overly narrow or silly, this often leads to Flight, Strength, Heart, as was common in The Silver Age of Comic Books. Suddenly Always Knew That is the same type of retcon as this, but instead of "Neither did I", the character will explain that You Didn't Ask.
Some characters get a pass on this due to a Swiss-Army Superpower ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmySuperpower"], where a very flexible superpower is set from the start, or an Adaptive Ability, where their power is explicitly the power to acquire new powers. Science Heroes are supposed to be building custom devices to deal with bizarre circumstances. Wizards in high magic settings tend to have this as an inherent power too for similar reasons — go check the spellbook for the obscure ritual that will save the day in this specific situation, and it makes sense for them not to have used such a situational spell before they needed it. Creative use of a Morph Weapon or the like can also justify this.
Tropes Are Tools ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools"], and many successful and loved works have characters whose power set just keeps surprisingly expanding. However, in stories meant to have at least some tension, this trope can slide into bad writing. The risk in showering down new powers constantly is that it becomes a go-to Deus ex Machina (or worse, an Ass Pull ). Having written themselves into a corner with a situation that's too overwhelming for our heroes to handle with the tools they've been given, the writer decides to have the hero conveniently learn the one ability needed to save the day. Do this too often, and it dulls the drama of any new situation that pops up later, as the audience won't respect the setting as having internal consistency or real limitations. This video explains it pretty well.
If a writer wants to sell a New Super Power ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSuperPower"] better, sticking in at least a little Foreshadowing of the possibility is considered good form. A Training from Hell to Unlock More True Potential also avoids this trope.
See 11th-Hour Superpower ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower"] when this trope happens during the climax. Compare Imagination-Based Superpower, Magic A Is Magic A, So Last Season, and finally Strong as They Need to Be. Contrast with The Worf Effect, where the plot demands the character's powers and abilities are suddenly rendered impotent; and Heart Is an Awesome Power and Swiss-Army Superpower, where a character has a very limited set of powers or skills and uses creativity to meet the needs of the plot. For the more prudent writer's alternative, see Sanderson's Third Law.
