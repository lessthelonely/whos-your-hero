This character, simply put, loves everyone. Loves them with a deep, spiritual love that means they will shake heaven and earth, destroy gods and planets, bring nations to their knees, etc. for the person they just met yesterday ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome"]. They will believe the best of everyone, and constantly give someone a second chance (though they will defeat the Big Bad). They repay cruelty with kindness and anger with calm. They are the ones who will suffer for the sins of their loved ones. Most people think they're insane, but somehow they pull it off.
The Empathic Weapon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon"] trusts them completely, as does every animal and child who immediately recognize the good in them and take quickly to them. Their every step causes flowers to bloom. Their circle of friends are in awe of them, if not somewhat in love with them. They'll even attract an Anti-Hero or two who will stick around so they can figure out what drugs this person is taking â€” and where they can get some. In their hands, The Power of Love and The Power of Friendship can be an awesome force, they may be the standard-bearer for the message that You Are Not Alone, You Are Better Than You Think You Are and if anything can redeem a person against the odds by showing them the light of goodness, it will probably be the All-Loving Hero.
On the Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism"], All-Loving Hero is a heavily idealistic character. Even in a dark world, they are ideal. They will always say Silly Rabbit, Cynicism Is for Losers! and inspire hope.
In terms of The Four Loves ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourLoves"], All-Loving Hero is Agape, or Unconditional Love for All, personified. However, by no means is the character exempt from the other three loves.
The Fool ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFool"] is sometimes the embryonic state of All-Loving Hero doubled as the Idiot Hero. A Magnetic Hero has the intangible quality of earning respect and followers that some All-Loving Hero characters do but without needing the "love and forgive everyone" part. An All-Loving Hero who takes their idealism too far into Facepalm-worthy idiocy (like seriously trying to trade the Artifact of Doom if the villain promises not to hurt anyone) may lapse into Stupid Good or Lawful Stupid, and they can also form into Kindhearted Simpletons if they manage to help others thoroughly. Such a character may have moments where they are Not So Above It All or fall short of this standard.
The viewpoint character in a White Man's Burden ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMansBurden"] story will often be an All-Loving Hero. For the character who only thinks they're All-Loving Hero, see the Love Freak. The Cutie shares a lot of the All-Loving Hero's characteristic personality type, but isn't as much of a paragon of idealism and may or may not have their overpowering charisma. Similarly, The Pollyanna has the All-Loving Hero's optimism and good heart but doesn't have the same kind of charisma or deep spiritualism. The Redeemer is often a trait caused by All-Loving Heroism.
Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] to Ideal Hero. Compare Martyr Without a Cause, The Paragon, The Heart, Incorruptible Pure Pureness, Purity Sue, Nice Guy, and Rousseau Was Right. In Shades of Conflict, this Trope heavily synergizes well with White-and-Grey Morality, thanks to the latter's principle that the characters are either good or misguided.
Although its previous trope name was The Messiah, this trope is not about Jesus-analogues; that's Messianic Archetype ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype"]. While they and All-Loving Hero sometimes overlap, a character with the Messianic Archetype ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype"] can be far-flung from being All-Loving Hero in mind and behavior.
Contrast Misanthrope Supreme ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisanthropeSupreme"], who has nothing but hatred for everyone; (although a more Anti-Villain version may have been a former All-Loving Hero, who came to believe that the only way to truly save everyone was taking extreme measures) and Dark Messiah, which can stand in opposition to this but is more Messianic Archetype + Anti-Hero. Dueling Messiahs is what happens when those two come to a head.
In the context of methods of climax fulfillment, this may be referred to as a "Love Hero". May overlap with For Happiness ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForHappiness"] as character motivation.
