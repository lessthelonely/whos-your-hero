The stereotype that a person who's mentally unstable makes for a passionate and satisfying lover. ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin"]
This is due to the belief that their mental instability makes them more enthusiastic and uninhibited, often being into unthinkable kinky stuff that a "normal and boring" person never would be. Power Dynamics Kink ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerDynamicsKink"] and Romanticized Abuse are frequently involved.
And if they're obsessed with a person in specific, such as a Yandere ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere"] or a Stalker with a Crush, there is the idea that they're so utterly devoted to that person's needs that they will go to any lengths in order to satisfy them.
This can be the excuse for why someone would want to remain in a relationship with someone who's obviously unhinged or why they want to have Sex with the Ex ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexWithTheEx"] with their Psycho Ex-Girlfriend.
This archetype is most commonly attributed to women since All Men Are Perverts ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts"] and are more willing to look past a person's flaws as long as they're getting laid. Sometimes they can see it's a bad idea, but will still consider the experience to be Worth It. Openly crazy men are usually not seen as attractive to women unless they also invoke a bad boy aura or a woman dates them under the belief they can "fix him".
Sister trope to Cute But Psycho ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteButPsycho"], which tends to feature characters who are somewhat younger, focusing more on things like high school crushes than adult sexual relationships.
Expect the phrase "Daddy Issues" ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIssues"] to be mentioned at least once.
This stereotype is commonly applied to Goths ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth"].
Compare Aroused by Idiocy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArousedByIdiocy"], which is about intelligence rather than mental illness. Frequently overlaps with The Ophelia; see also Dominatrix, Evil Is Sexy, Mad Love, Sadist, Sex God, and Sex Is Violence. The trope itself can be considered Unfortunate Implications due to it sexualizing and fetishizing women with mental health issues in addition to being an offshoot of Hysterical Woman, which itself portrays women as overly emotional and mentally unstable.
