There's a problem, and the heroes can't solve it or make it go away. It boils down to a situation that requires a decidedly unheroic action ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog"] to solve, whether it's hurting, killing, or something even less pleasant. The heroes can't very well do it and still be classic White Hats, but not doing anything would have grave consequences. Who can save the day now? Not the Big Damn Heroes, but the villains! Hey, they're evil already, doing an evil act to save the day is no problem. Essentially the author's version of Take a Third Option in a narrative lose/lose situation.
Different from a Heelâ€“Face Turn ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn"] because the villain isn't necessarily being heroic; the villain may be entirely motivated out of self-interest, such as fighting a common threat or because a competitor is challenging his place as nemesis. Another possibility is it makes them even for a previous Save the Villain behavior. If they're on friendly terms with the heroes, they may take it upon themselves to get their hands dirty specifically so that the good guys won't have to. It's possible for it to even be a complete coincidence. At any rate, in more philosophic works, the villain will be likely to subject the hero to some flavor of "The Reason You Suck" Speech, explaining that the hero can only afford to be so squeaky clean because of this trope. Sometimes, this role will fall to a Superpowered Evil Side of a protagonist if the protagonist has a Split-Personality Team situation going on.
Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] of Non-Protagonist Resolver; in this case, the "resolver" is the villain. Contrast Villainous Rescue, where a villain pulls a Big Damn Heroes without committing any acts that were too reprehensible for the good guys in the process. If the villain saves the day by accident by doing something villainous, that's Nice Job Fixing It, Villain. Overlaps with The Dog Bites Back when the "dog" is a minion. See Disney Villain Death for when there is no other bad guy to do the work, so it is done by gravity. If the hero deliberately sets it up, this is a possible case of Do with Him as You Will. Compare Always a Bigger Fish, when a usually non-sapient monster saves the heroes from another monster. Contrast Won't Do Your Dirty Work, where someone (usually either a Token Good Teammate or someone on the villain's team who is a lesser evil), gets ordered to do a morally questionable task and refuses.
No Place for Me There ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlaceForMeThere"] and Necessarily Evil are this trope applied to Utopia Justifies the Means.
