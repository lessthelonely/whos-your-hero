    <hero:tropeDescription>The slow accretion of attractive changes to characters who are actually supposed to be fairly odd-looking, if not outright ugly. It doesn't just mean a costume change at some point in the story; here, the physical appearance inexplicably changes. This shouldn't be confused with a design that happens to be very attractive to fandoms with certain kinks; that is more or less out of the original designer's hands. Nor when it's just the artstyle itself is becoming refined, ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution"] though it can overlap. This trope refers to the slow changes to make the character more marketable that happen over the course of a series or multiple adaptations, even if it feels detrimental to the character with their initial unusual design becoming more generic and less interesting-looking. This is very common with female characters, even ones designed to deliberately avoid this trope, once they get out of the hands of their creators. Even mythological creatures may be prettied up, as tends to happen with the Gorgeous Gorgon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GorgeousGorgon"]. In the case of males, this is particularly common in villains and anti-heroes when they undergo a Heel–Face Turn ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn"] or when they Took a Level in Kindness, because Beauty Equals Goodness. May also be the case with female villains when they become more heroic, but those are more often already attractive. A related trope is Self-Fanservice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFanservice"] (where it's the fans doing this to the canon art). In cases where this comes to the detriment of the integrity of the character, one of the intermediate depictions may be considered a Franchise Original Sin in hindsight. Compare Fanservice Pack, Adaptational Attractiveness, Anthropomorphic Shift, Unnecessary Makeover, Art Evolution, Girliness Upgrade, Bishōnen Line, and With Great Power Comes Great Hotness. Contrast You Don't Look Like You ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontLookLikeYou"].</hero:tropeDescription>
