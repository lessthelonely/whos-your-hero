An Action Girl ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl"] appears otherwise slender, svelte, or "waifish", with a near-total lack of visible musculature.

This is a tiny bit Truth in Television ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"] as women, even ones with big looking muscle, usually can't match men for upper body strength and speed. However, women are often more flexible, so it makes some sense they might want to use that advantage. This still doesn't eliminate the lack of mass and power thus a woman's hits won't pack as much of a punch (the reason why weight categories exist in combat sports).
