Virtually everyone has to wear a public mask in order to be accepted by others. That's a simple fact of human psychology. When circumstances (such as anonymity, strong emotion, or sufficient power) allow a character to take off that mask and act in complete accord with their inclinations, they reveal what's beneath the mask.
The secrets this mask hides are varied and are not always dark. A villain, for example, may be hiding a soft spot ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog"].
Sometimes a person may never know they had a hidden self before the mask comes off. The change is even a surprise to them. Other times the person is well aware of their hidden self and are determined to keep it hidden. This hidden self that people don't show to others is what Beneath the Mask is about.
This hidden self is sometimes portrayed as "the real self". Occasionally the person actually wants someone to see their hidden side (the "real me") but for some reason can never get people to see it. More complex works might argue that the hidden self is just a part of the real self and that the public self is also part of the real self.
The concept in Western philosophy originated with Carl Jung ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CarlJung"], who referred to the mask people wear in public as the "persona" (Latin via Ancient Greek for "mask"), and their hidden desires as their "shadow."
In Eastern philosophy, this is considered synonymous with the concept of "Face". Every person has two sides: a persona they must wear for the good of society, and another which expresses their own desires (in Japan, these concepts are referred to as "tatamae" and "honne"). Juggling both is considered important; too much tatamae can leave a person seeming fake or shallow, or with dangerously-repressed desires, but too much honne can make a person look like an idiot manchild ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild"] at best and a complete sociopath at worst.

Often used in conjunction with Hidden Heart of Gold, Jerk with a Heart of Gold, Bitch in Sheep's Clothing, Evil All Along, Good All Along, Sugar-and-Ice Personality, Sad Clown, Stepford Smiler, Undercover When Alone, Broken Ace, and The Proud Elite. Obfuscating Stupidity and Obfuscating Insanity can be subtropes, as can A Darker Me.
Not to be confused with ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant"] Hidden Depths, which is about skills and roles rather than personality. Compare and contrast Becoming the Mask, where the facade itself actually becomes part of the character's personality.
