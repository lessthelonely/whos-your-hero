Not every Super Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero"] or action hero has an Elaborate Underground Base or Big Fancy House; some of them don't seem to even have an apartment. But for those who have a multi-million dollar headquarters or mansion filled with high-tech gear, a garage full of Cool Cars, and a closet filled with custom-made suits, there is a compulsion to ask, "Where did all this costly stuff come from?" Where did the architects, carpenters, masons, cablers, plumbers, electricians, welders, and tailors come from? And how much did it cost to hire them all? If the entire headquarters seems to run itself, you may ask who maintains all that equipment?
It's especially likely to be asked if the character in question doesn't have magical powers or super abilities that would enable them to believably carve out the insides of a mountain for a secret hideout with their own bare hands on a spare weekend.
To a certain degree, this is an Acceptable Break from Reality ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreakFromReality"], because we want to see the hero bravely swooping in to rescue a Damsel in Distress and capture the Big Bad, not watch them doing the reams of boring administrative paperwork needed to run their headquarters operation.
In the best case scenario, the superhero or action hero has a day job as Tech Bro ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechBro"] or company president, which makes a million dollar salary plausible, or they are heir to a huge family fortune. But sometimes, this question is just left up in the air, with the writers hoping it'll stay as Fridge Logic. Other times, they take it head-on, providing an in-character source â€” often, an Acme Products company or a single person who makes it their business to outfit heroes and/or villains.
