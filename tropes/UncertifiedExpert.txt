A character regarded as an expert or veteran regularly does something or operates something that you're supposed to have training or some sort of official certification for, such as a license. He may even be a mentor training a pupil.
It gets revealed that he doesn't actually have the official qualification. He may have been Incompletely Trained ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompletelyTrained"], or decided to side-step the system. Or perhaps he was denied the opportunity to qualify, but was able to "fake it till you make it." In some cases he may have a Phony Degree as part of the deception.
Unlike with an Anti-Mentor ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMentor"], he's actually competent, and obviously doesn't need the training or testing he didn't get, either because of his natural talent or from having been Taught by Experience by the time this is revealed.
Compare Anti-Mentor ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMentor"], where the "expert" is faking it (or is just very bad at teaching,) and Obsolete Mentor, who did have the training but hasn't stayed up to date. Compare and contrast Back-Alley Doctor, in which being an uncertified expert (in medicine) makes one hard to practice it openly, unlike in this trope. See also I'm Not a Doctor, but I Play One on TV, when the only claimed certification is acting the role of a fictional expert.
