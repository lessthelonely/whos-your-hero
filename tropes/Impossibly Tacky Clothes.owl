    <hero:tropeDescription>When it's clear In-Universe ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse"] that the clothing tried to be fancy but ended up a mess. Some people like fancy, detailed clothing, but it's not always easy to make such clothes look good. It could be that the character/dressmaker/culture ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats"] has no taste (and also why some people rightly prefer Simple, yet Opulent clothing). Or that the outfit was really rushed and this is the unfortunate result. Or the writer/designer is making a point about fashion trends. This last may involve caricatures of Real Life outfits. Often occurs with bridesmaids' dresses in sitcoms. They're ugly, but the bride thinks they're beautiful - or the bride knows that they're ugly, and picks them so that she looks better by comparison. Again this is not when the viewer thinks an outfit is bad. That's What The Hell, Costuming Department? ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WTHCostumingDepartment"]. This trope is when the writer/designer deliberately states that a costume is bad, either in direct narrative voice or via the reactions of the characters in the story. This often overlaps with (again has to be an in-universe overlap): A Super-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTrope"] to Tacky Tuxedo, Homemade Sweater from Hell. Compare Scenery Gorn ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryGorn"], Fashion Dissonance, Uncanny Valley Makeup Contrast Impossibly Cool Clothes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyCoolClothes"] and Opulent Outfits.</hero:tropeDescription>
