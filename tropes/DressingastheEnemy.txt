Most of the heroes are trapped in a cell, when the door opens and a guard wearing a face-concealing ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons"] helmet enters.
They prepare for a fight. The guard takes off his/her helmet â€” and reveals that it's one of their allies.
In the real world, this is illegal for a military operation (under Article 39 ["https://tvtropes.orghttp://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Article.xsp?action=openDocument&documentId=C5D71B78117289FBC12563CD0051DB3C"] of Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions) but not when it comes to espionage (where they'll kill you anyway if you get caught) unless you take off the uniform before you start firing, and other things.
Note that the guard the hero knocks out is always wearing the right size uniform to fit them perfectly. (Except in parodies, in which case it fits them very poorly). This may or may not follow a Mugged for Disguise ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggedForDisguise"].
This occurs so often that Rule Number 1 on the Evil Overlord List ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlordList"] is that the Legions of Doom should wear clear helmets. Another rule from that list calls for guards to wear tailored uniforms which will not fit any hero who attempts this trick.
It's a very common mythic trope called 'Wearing Enemy's Skin' identified by Joseph Campbell. Known examples go back to The Iliad ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIliad"], thus Older Than Feudalism.
In fantasy settings where some sort of magical powers are available, a common variation of this involves fully transforming The Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero"] into one of the enemy.
May lead to Friend or Foe? ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrFoe"] since you do, after all, look like the enemy.
See also The Mole ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole"], Trojan Prisoner, Hey, Wait!, Dead Person Impersonation. On a regimental scale, this is a False Flag Operation. When used with zombies, it's Pretend We're Dead. When the disguised arouses suspicion by constantly insisting on his alliance to the enemy, it's Most Definitely Not a Villain. Contrast Disguised Hostage Gambit and False Innocence Trick.
