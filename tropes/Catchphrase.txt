An expression used by a character numerous times in a work. Merely uttering this phrase in the office will clue others in to the character you're referring to.
To be a Character Catchphrase, the phrase must be repeated multiple times in an identifiable way â€” what is simply the most memorable line of a movie is not a Character Catchphrase unless it is repeated by the same in-universe character. When it's the audience that adopts a character's line as a Catchphrase, it's a Memetic Mutation ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation"].
If the character has a Badass Creed ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCreed"], it will probably double as a Catchphrase. Beam Me Up, Scotty! is a false or oft-misquoted Catchphrase. Compare Arc Words, One-Liner, Other Stock Phrases, Word Power. Contrast with Author Catchphrase, which is when a phrase is recycled across unrelated works by the same author/actor/creator.
