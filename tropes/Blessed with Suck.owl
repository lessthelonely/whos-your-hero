    <hero:tropeDescription>One way or the other, something you think is going to be useful turns out to be worthless. Blessed with Suck is one of those tropes that comes in a few distinct flavors. Generally, it's when a character is given a special ability that seems to cause nothing but trouble: This blessing may take the form of Applied Phlebotinum ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum"], privileges, or special abilities. For artistic cases (real or (self-) imagined), see Muse Abuse. May be caused by a Literal Genie ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie"]. May also result in With Great Power Comes Great Insanity either as part of the blessing or a result of its psychological effects. Opposite side of the same coin from Cursed with Awesome ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome"], in which a "curse" actually is cool and helps the character, even if they refuse to believe it and just want to be normal. If the "blessing" is somehow removed via Aesop learning, then the Curse Is Foiled Again. If a character is given a lame power but manages to use it to great effect, you've found that Heart Is an Awesome Power. This is Older Than Feudalism ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism"], and it's a perfect way to teach the Aesop of Be Careful What You Wish For. Supertrope to Does Not Know His Own Strength, Immunity Disability, Midas Touch, So Beautiful, It's a Curse, and Who Wants to Live Forever?. Compare/contrast with Awesome, but Impractical ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical"] (which it is often mistaken for by the looks of most of the tropes), Super Loser, Super Zeroes, Power Incontinence, Bad Powers, Bad People. See also Curse. Contrast a Curse That Cures, when a Curse cures a character of an illness or disease they already had. For characters blessed with awesome, see With Great Power Comes Great Perks.</hero:tropeDescription>
