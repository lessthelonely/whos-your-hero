If a character is immortal — even if it's the "immortal but can die temporarily" type — then their opponents don't need to hold anything back. Not even if those opponents are good guys.
Immortality ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality"] is a sweet gig. Whether it's because the character can download into a new body as part of a Hive Mind, has a Healing Factor strong enough to reconstruct From a Single Cell, or possesses some even stranger way of staying among the living. The downside is everyone else now considers you fair game for target practice.
It's common sense. There's nothing wrong with using non-lethal force to stop someone. So what if it just so happens that, with this person, non-lethal force happens to include bullets? It's not that the code against killing ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill"] doesn't apply. They're just not killing anyone. Which means heroes who normally have to Set Swords to "Stun" to avoid things getting messy, or otherwise take pains to Never Bring a Knife to a Fist Fight can now cut loose against the immortal enemy.
This can be implicit or acknowledged in the story. The characters might never come out and say that they feel no remorse for blowing off a regenerator's head or throwing a grenade into a room full of robo-clones, or they may well explain it at length as a form of dehumanizing their enemy or as Trash Talk ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk"] in a fight.
It's worth noting that this trope is often applied on targets that can bleed and feel pain. No Bloodless Carnage ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage"] here. The trope provides interesting opportunities mostly because it allows for more substantial violence against important characters while avoiding the usual complications (moral and physical) for both attacker and victim.
Contrast Good Thing You Can Heal ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal"], where the immortal character happens to take lethal injuries through bad luck (although the two can overlap). See also What Measure Is a Non-Human?, Uniqueness Value, Self-Mutilation Demonstration, and Immortality Hurts. Fearless Undead can fit this as well, depending on the nature of the undead. May be played alongside a "No More Holding Back" Speech. Don't mistake it for Living Forever is No Big Deal, which has nothing to do with it beyond both being immortality tropes.
