Someone who is Inexplicably Awesome is Shrouded in Myth ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth"]. Whatever Backstory, secret origin or Mysterious Past an Inexplicably Awesome character has is by definition locked away; their existence is a conundrum. They usually display powers or abilities that are unusual if not downright bizarre for the setting, and exhibit eccentricities to match. One would assume that such an impenetrable enigma would be a source of gallons of plot, and they'd be right, although not in the obvious way: rather than being a puzzle to solve, their very presence is typically a plot generator, setting people and events in motion as a direct result of their oddball take on reality.
It should be noted, that they only are this trope if they are genuinely unique in their setting. If "he/she must be a Time Lord ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TimeLord"]" is a workable explanation for a character and the series isn't even Doctor Who, odds are it's this trope. note Or you've been spending too much time in the Wild Mass Guessing page. They can be anyone from a near omnipotent being to a mere weirdo, but that does not make them any less weird either way.
Attempting to actually explain their awesome may have unintended and hazardous consequences ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideEffectsInclude"], including but not limited to Cerebus Retcons and, in some severe cases, the dreaded Voodoo Shark.
Compare with The Wonka ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWonka"], a character who is successful owing to unique/crazy logic and who may overlap with this trope (as its Trope Namer does — see Literature below).
