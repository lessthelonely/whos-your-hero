The most dangerous form of Brainwashed ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed"], for everyone concerned.
A character is hypnotized ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypnoticEyes"]/mind-controlled/whatnot and sent to kill their friends or do something similarly destructive. This may lead them to believe that their once-friends are enemies they have to take down.
This trope has been tested and busted ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TropesExaminedByTheMythbusters"] by MythBusters in regard to hypnosis; most hypnotists and hypnotherapists (and plenty of fictional villains, for that matter) agree that this kind of mind control through hypnosis isn't possible, as the subject must want to go through with the suggestion for it to work or, at least, have no good reason to object. Which means an alternate interpretation would be that the brainwashing victim wanted to go through with it, if "hypnosis" is used as the explanation for such behavior.
On the other hand, if a writer wants to convey ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork"] that a Brainwashed and Crazy character is indeed such and got that way unknowingly or unwillingly and/or is acting against his or her own interests, the writer will not depict hypnosis as the method of mind control, because there are far more effective (and far more frightening) ways an individual can be manipulated and/or controlled to act in a harmful or dangerous manner. The Real Life Trope Maker for this would be Nazi Germany, though a continuing situation of Domestic Abuse in Real Life is a far more common example.
It may require Deprogramming ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deprogram"] to cure, if the mind-controller doesn't try to force them to break an Intrinsic Vow. Also may result in an "I Know You're in There Somewhere" Fight, ultimately resulting in a Dying as Yourself if they cannot be cured or freed and thusly must be destroyed, or kill themselves to spare their friends.
A subtrope of Face–Monster Turn ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceMonsterTurn"]. This trope is the inverse of Heel–Face Brainwashing. Compare with Enemy Exchange Program. See also Mirror Morality Machine.
Please do not add Real Life ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife"] examples.
