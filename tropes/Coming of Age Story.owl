    <hero:tropeDescription>A story featuring an adolescent making the mental leap from child to adult. In real life, this happens over the course of several years. Literature, films and some television series are media that have the space to show the story at a slow pace. But for a movie, things have to be compressed to several months at the most, so expect some really accelerated character development. The words bildungsroman (Ger. "educational novel") or bildungsgeschichte (Ger. "educational story") are sometimes used to describe these kinds of stories. A note on the translation: the terms originated in the Age of Enlightenment ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEnlightenment"], when "Bildung" meant not only "education" but also "self-improvement" (cf. English "building") â€” or as Werner Heisenberg put it, Bildung is "that which is still there after you've forgotten everything you had ever learned". In other words, it's not a "novel to educate the readers" but a "novel about the hero becoming someone". Usually includes some combination of the following: A variation is the Delayed Coming of Age Story, in which the person has remained mentally a child ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild"] their entire life and only finally experiences these things sometime between their late 20s and mid-40s. Mainstream film coming-of-age stories tend toward dramedy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dramedy"]. Independent film or novel stories lean toward drama, sometimes jumping headlong into Wangst.
