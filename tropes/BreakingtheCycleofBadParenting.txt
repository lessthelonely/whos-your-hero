When parents or parental figures do a much better job at raising kids compared to their own parents.
How this happens varies between people. Maybe they know how they were raised wasn't the best and decides not to repeat the mistakes with their own kids. Maybe it's a case of Values Dissonance ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance"]; what might have been good parenting back in the day would look poorly in modern society.
Expect some parents to still have some issues in raising their kids because of how they were raised. They may still be seen as abusive or neglectful, but when compared to the people that raised them, they are seen as better. There might be a chance they will realize they are making the same mistakes as their parents and do try and correct it.
This trope will very frequently overlap with Parents as People ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsAsPeople"] in stories where parents consciously make an effort to do better. In happier stories where parental figures succeed in breaking this cycle, Good Parents will also come into play.
