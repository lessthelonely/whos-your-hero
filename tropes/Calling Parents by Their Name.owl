    <hero:tropeDescription>Children, no matter their age, usually refer to their parents as "mom/mum and dad", "mommy/mummy and daddy", "mother and father", or the like. When they are on a First-Name Basis ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis"] it usually means something significant about their family. It could be that mom and dad are Hippie Parents or Open Minded Parents, or simply pragmatism for those that have same-sex parents. It could be that the child is bratty and rebellious. Maybe the parent in question didn't meet their child until adulthood or weren't the primary caregiver, or maybe their relationship just isn't very good. It could even be merely a case of You Called Me "X"; It Must Be Serious. This is a common way to tell a biological parent You're Not My Father. In Eastern media, this act is taken much more seriously, as it is virtually unheard of for children to call their parents by only their name. When present, it is often a sign of extreme estrangement or even outright hostility between parent and child. Step-parents, foster parents, and sometimes adopted parents are usually (but not always) exempt from the "Don't call your parents by their name" rule, especially if they're relatively new. Compare First-Name Basis ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis"] and Parental Title Characterization. See New Parent Nomenclature Problem for the problem of what to call a step-parent or parental substitute. A Significant Name Shift may occur depending on the relationship.</hero:tropeDescription>
