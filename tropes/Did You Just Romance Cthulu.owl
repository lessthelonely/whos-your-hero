    <hero:tropeDescription>This is what happens when you make love (in either ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTropes"] sense of that phrase) with an Eldritch Abomination, or a Starfish Alien doing a passable imitation of one. Tentacles are a frequent feature. Can be played for sheer Squick, horror, fanservice, laughs or all of the above at the same time. In Lovecraft Lite works, they may well be an Adorable Abomination with genuine romantic chemistry with their mortal partner. In Cosmic Horror Stories, expect a lot more rapey or crazy cultist vibes to this trope. Might lead to Fetus ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetusTerrible"]/Enfant Terrible. A common origin for the Anti-Anti-Christ, able to switch sides as a representation of the human side, but just as likely to become a monster. Subtrope of Unequal Pairing ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalPairing"] and Interspecies Romance. Compare and contrast Did We Just Have Tea with Cthulhu?, Mars Needs Women, Boldly Coming, and Divine Date.</hero:tropeDescription>
