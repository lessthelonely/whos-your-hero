    <hero:tropeDescription>The character, or someone close to the character, has been raped ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama"]. And now it's time to settle the score. It might develop into a Roaring Rampage of Revenge or Ax-Crazy vigilantism, but it might also take a far more sophisticated turn. In a way, it is an inversion of Honor-Related Abuse ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorRelatedAbuse"], making sure that it is the attacker rather than the victim who is Defiled Forever. Rape and revenge accepts the premise that rape constitutes permanent destruction, but adds the idea that it's not necessarily the victim who gets destroyed. She can avert being Defiled Forever by defiling her abuser back... or maybe it will turn into a black hole where everyone is damned. In most cases, of course, the one carrying out the revenge is the victim, but not always. This Trope also covers times where a sibling, spouse, or pretty much any other close relation of the victim decides to track the rapist down. Vengeance for violation is a subset of "Crime Pursued by Vengeance," one of the situations found in Georges Polti's Thirty Six Dramatic Situations ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThirtySixDramaticSituations"]. For rape as revenge, see Karmic Rape ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicRape"]. By the way, we need to mention something really important: although many stories involve cops, judges, or juries simply looking the other way ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw"], the type of pre-meditated manhunts that are standard to this trope would be seen as murder by an actual, real court of law. As a result, we must ask you No Real Life Examples, Please!</hero:tropeDescription>
