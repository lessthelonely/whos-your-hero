A trope where characters with a Limited Wardrobe ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe"] or Iconic Outfit find themselves wearing far too little to possibly be comfortable or healthy given the current temperature — but will usually not act any differently to how they do in other temperatures.
It should be noted that this trope was born and is still used to show how badass and/or "hardcore" a character was, not necessarily about fanservice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice"] as you might gather from the picture. It started with the Shirtless Barbarian figure popularized by Conan the Barbarian; it was a simple shorthand to demonstrate how savage, deadly and probably superhuman the individual is. It's through the abuse of writers to show a little skin — often by Stripperiffic or Chainmail Bikini — that this has come to the trope of today.
Curiously, this is just slightly less unrealistic than it seems ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic"]. In real life, there are a sect of monks who can control their own temperature and avoid frostbite even in below-zero temperatures; this is, of course, exaggerated in fiction. On a more mundane level, acclimation to cold is experienced by most people who live in areas that experience a cold season, and those who live in colder climates in general will be better acclimated to cold weather. Hence what qualifies as "T-shirt weather" to a Colombian and a Swede will probably differ dramatically, sometimes to the extent that this trope appears to be in play to those from warmer areas.
This trope also applies to other times the clothing is grossly inappropriate to the environment. To be expected in video games, especially free-roaming ones, unless finding appropriate clothing becomes a Broken Bridge ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge"].
This trope is related to Harmless Freezing ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessFreezing"] and Frigid Water Is Harmless. It is also often complementary to Martial Artists Are Always Barefoot, as it's usually a pretty quick and easy way of establishing a character as a badass who scoffs at rugged terrain and hostile climates.
Not to be confused with being exposed to ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant"] literal (classical) elements.
Compare Fur Bikini ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurBikini"] and Loincloth.
