A convoluted plan that relies on events completely within the realm of chance, yet goes off without a hitch. If your first reaction to seeing The Plan ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan"] unfold is "There is no way that you could have planned that would happen!", then it's a Gambit Roulette.
A Gambit Roulette tries to make a character seem impressive, but can break Willing Suspension of Disbelief ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief"] if not done correctly. You really have to establish a character as The Chessmaster for them to be able to pull this off without arousing your audience's skepticism. If the character pulling the roulette is a god, a person with precognition, a hyper-advanced AI, or someone else with similar abilities interacting with mortals, it becomes somewhat more believable, but even then, the suspension of disbelief can be tenuous at best.
If, as part of retconning ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon"] in a new villain, everything up to then (including the supposed successes of the heroes against the old villains) is all part of a new Evil Plan, it's Arc Welding. Also often the justification of the Omniscient Morality License; their control over events is supposedly total. Many examples could be part of a Xanatos Gambit where it simply never became necessary to tell the audience about any other contingencies.
May be parodied by having events obviously (and blatantly) be out of the character's control, and yet still have them take credit for it ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies"].
Note that complexity alone does not make a plan into roulette. A few separate plans may combine while individually making logical sense. When a dozen things are going on but the actual details of the plan aren't reliant on each item fortuitously fitting into place, then it's a Gambit Pileup ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup"]. If the character has plans for either outcome, not just the improbable one, it's Xanatos Gambit. If they admit that they hadn't planned for certain occurrences, but took advantage of them as they came up, that's Xanatos Speed Chess. Contrast Batman Gambit which is based on the most likely outcome, based on the planner's knowledge of the people involved, rather than an improbable one. A roulette requires the planner to say that events that were literally impossible to predict were All According to Plan.
