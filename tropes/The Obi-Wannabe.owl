    <hero:tropeDescription>He's older and ostensibly wiser, and more than willing to impart his wisdom upon his children, younger siblings, or other youngster. There's just one problem: his advice sucks! Sometimes he's just clueless, but other times, he's intentionally misleading his protege ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sabotutor"]. The most common subversion of the Mentor Archetype ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorArchetype"], with whom he often forms Opposed Mentors. Overlaps with Know-Nothing Know-It-All and The Blind Leading the Blind. Oftentimes invokes an Ice-Cream Koan. Compare and contrast Mission Control Is Off Its Meds, Anti-Mentor, and Uncertified Expert.</hero:tropeDescription>
