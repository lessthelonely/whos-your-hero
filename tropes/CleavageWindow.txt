A cut in a woman's top that shows her breast cleavage, whether it's on the top or front side. It doesn't matter the shape or the size, as long as the window is completely enclosed and clearly shows breast cleavage. It also doesn't matter about the rest of the outfit, as this can be on a bathing suit, a sweater ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySweaterGirl"], a Leotard of Power, a Minidress of Power, or a grand Pimped-Out Dress.
If the cleavage window creates a gap in the protection of a character's chest armor, that armor is a Chainmail Bikini ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainmailBikini"].
Obviously a form of Fanservice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice"], and likely Author Appeal.
Compare Most Common Superpower ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostCommonSuperpower"], Navel-Deep Neckline (which can overlap if the window drops far enough), Impossibly-Low Neckline, Naked in Mink, Male Gaze. Sister Trope to Navel Window, which applies the same general idea of exposure to the character's belly button without fully baring the midriff.
