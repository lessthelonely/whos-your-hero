This character is Immortal ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality"], but not because they have Nigh-Invulnerability or can regenerate any injury. They are immortal because they don't age, nor do they usually sicken. This character will never die from natural causes. However, they are just as vulnerable to injury as a normal person, and any normally fatal injury will prove fatal to them as well. This is frequently a racial trait of elves and almost always a feature of robots and vampires.
Of course, this trope can be combined with many other Immortality Tropes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityTropes"], particularly Nigh-Invulnerability. Characters that are extremely difficult to kill while also unable to age provides convenience for long-running series, and can also give villains credibility in terms of their threat (an Evil Overlord that can rule the Earth forever is clearly more threatening than one with average human lifespan).
Frequently overlaps with Immortality Begins at Twenty ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty"]. Also frequently overlaps with immortality by Healing Factor or From a Single Cell, to the point it's more unusual to find someone with a Healing Factor without slowed or stopped aging than one with it. If this trope is combined with Nigh-Invulnerability and taken to its logical extreme, it may become Complete Immortality. It is also not uncommon for ageless beings to continue to grow in strength and vigor over their long lives.
It should be noted that what we call "dying from old age" is actually an accumulation of small illnesses and damages to the body, which result in the immune system either getting weaker or overwhelmed until it gets defeated. The Ageless is thus someone who is simply immune to these low-scale sickness though it raises questions as to where the immunity starts and where it stops ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic"].
Compare Long-Lived ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived"], Really 700 Years Old. Contrast Life Drinker, which involves stealing lifeforce from victims to maintain immortality, rather than the non-aging being an innate trait to begin with.
