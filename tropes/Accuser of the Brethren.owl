    <hero:tropeDescription>So, you've got The Atoner ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner"], he has done some bad things and regrets them. He works hard to be redeemed and you think he's going to get support, right? Wrong. There is a character, a very vindictive person who wants nothing better than to force the Atoner to wallow in their guilt. Perhaps The Atoner ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner"] was once The Dragon, and his master wants him to feel that redemption is impossible. Perhaps it was someone who was hurt by The Atoner ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner"] and doesn't want them to be redeemed, because what they did to them is something they cannot forgive. The former often overlaps with Evil Cannot Comprehend Good and the latter case usually overlaps with He Who Fights Monsters. In some cases, this is because the person who refuses to forgive The Atoner ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner"] believes that he is only faking his remorse. Sometimes, the accuser may become the sole reason why the Atoner decides to become evil again. The refusing, vindictive person might be called out by the others, for holding grudges. A sibling to Rejected Apology ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RejectedApology"], where one character refuses to accept an apology from another character. Compare to Never Accepted In His Home Town, Inspector Javert, Reformed, but Rejected, No Sympathy For Grudge Holders, and He Who Fights Monsters. See Dislikes the New Guy when the same scenario happens not with an atoner but a new member on a team. Contrast with Karma Houdini and also Easily Forgiven. If the accuser is right all along but no one believes him, it overlaps with Cassandra Truth.</hero:tropeDescription>
