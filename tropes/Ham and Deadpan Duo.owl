    <hero:tropeDescription>A pair of characters, either lifelong partners or just met up, in which one is a ham of decent size and the other speaks in a deadpan tone. The juxtaposition of the two, along with each of them on their own, is a common source of comedy for the audience. Can overlap with a few Duo Tropes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuoTropes"]:</hero:tropeDescription>
