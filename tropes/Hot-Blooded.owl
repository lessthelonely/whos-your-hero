    <hero:tropeDescription>They are burningly passionate about everything that they do. They give their all in absolutely everything, regardless of the task. They do not know how to be half-hearted or lackadaisical about anything they care about. These characters are Hot-Blooded. Using the power of guts, determination, and badassery they throw themselves headfirst ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker"] into the worst situations imaginable and come out on top through sheer force of will and often have a strong tendency to do impressive things. Even non hot-blooded characters or the nicest ones can occasionally have their own hot-blooded incidents; this is frequently their Moment of Awesome. Beware if they go into an Unstoppable Rage ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage"] or Tranquil Fury; someone's really managed to piss them off. Triple that for elemental or Personality Powers; they're likely Playing with Fire. Especially common in the Super Robot Genre. The hot-blooded person is usually, though not always, identifiable by a mane of scarlet hair and/or Hot Blooded Sideburns. A common trait of The Ace and, to a lesser degree, the Boisterous Bruiser. This trait is a staple of Choleric characters in a Four-Temperament Ensemble. Compare with the: Not to be confused with ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant"] My Blood Runs Hot, which is when a character has literal hot blood, though at least some of these characters may be metaphorically Hot Blooded as well.</hero:tropeDescription>
