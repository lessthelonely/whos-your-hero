Maybe it's a useful visual shorthand to show that a female character is evil (or at least antiheroic) ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy"] and dominant. Maybe it's just an excuse for including some Author Appeal or Fanservice. Or maybe it's both. In any case, many evil or antiheroic dominant female characters wear costumes obviously inspired by Dominatrix outfits.
However, these ladies are never shown to be actual dominatrices, in the BDSM ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BDSM"] sense. Their dominatrix-inspired costumes are their "work clothes" (superhero/villain outfits, uniforms, etc.) rather than something they wear to the bedroom.
Common elements include:
Note: To qualify for this trope, the character's costume as a whole, in conjunction with her personality, should be reminiscent of a dominatrix. On the other hand, if a character is an actual dominatrix, she's not this trope either, instead fitting the Dominatrix ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dominatrix"] archetype.
This trope can overlap with Evil Is Sexy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy"] and Evil Wears Black (not all these women are evil, and not all these costumes are black) and Stripperriffic (not all these costumes are impractical for the characters that wear them). This is usually the easiest way to accomplish Sensible Heroes, Skimpy Villains (even though there are other ways).
May contain Spy Catsuit ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpyCatsuit"] and Combat Stilettos. Evil Costume Switch often results in this. The character wearing this might be a Combat Sadomasochist, or an outright Sadist. The Baroness is sometimes dressed this way. Compare Bondage Is Bad. Subversions where the character is dressed like this but they don't fit the personality aspect of this trope fall under Freaky Fashion, Mild Mind.
