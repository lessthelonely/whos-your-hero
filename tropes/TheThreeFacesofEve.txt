The Wife is the calmer, more reliable personality, and is someone around whom one could build a home life. This does not necessarily mean she is motherly. The Seductress is passionate, sexually experienced and independent. The "Child" (who does not have to be a literal child) is innocent, perhaps painfully so, sweet and kind.
So in short, a triad of:
All three character types are considered to be very feminine â€” with Child representing Light Feminine, Seductress representing Dark Feminine ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightFeminineAndDarkFeminine"] and Wife being in the middle. Instead of butch, femme, and neither it's (lady-like) femme, (overtly sexy) femme, and (girly) femme.
As a Villainess Trio ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart"], the Wife is very often the calculating, informative villainess. The Seductress is the more hands-on, sadistic (sometimes even lewd) villainess. With the Child commonly posing as the deceptively naive, cutesy glue to hold them together.
Contrast:
Named for the 1957 film The Three Faces of Eve ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeFacesOfEve"], about a woman with multiple personalities representing each of these types.
