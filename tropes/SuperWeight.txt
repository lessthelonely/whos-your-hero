So, your character's Power Level ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevel"] is off the scale. That's just swell! Too bad it doesn't actually mean anything. Therefore, the contributors of the wiki have created a "scale" to measure a character's power. The Super Weight scale doesn't quantify power by Random Power Ranking using arbitrary numbers, but rather categorizes characters into nine broad categories based on what a given character can do.
It's not uncommon to see characters all over this scale in a setting, nor is it unheard of for characters to change Weight Class during the course of a story, whether up ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering"] or down. Characters that have won the Sup ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering"]erpower Lottery will usually end up ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering"] on the higher levels of this scale.
When editing lists, remember that the weight classes measure the scope of a character's abilities â€” what the character is literally capable (and incapable) of with their raw power alone. While people like Batman ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman"] and The Doctor have been known to take on gods, they do so with intellect and tactics rather than raw power, and thus remain low on the list relative to their defeated opponents. Thus, defeating somebody does NOT necessarily place a character at or above the opposing weight class, although the greater the disparity between the subjects, the more the defeat qualifies as an example of Did You Just Punch Out Cthulhu?.
Likewise, as these are broad categories, remember that it's entirely possible for one character to clearly be stronger than another character within the same weight class. Simply being within the same tier in no way implies being identical or even especially close in power, just that they're closer to each other in power than to characters in higher or lower tiers. This is generally more likely to happen with higher-tier characters, but by no means is that always the case.

Compare Character Tiers ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTiers"], which is this in terms of usefulness in competitive play, and Sliding Scale of Villain Threat, which assesses the danger level of villains.
