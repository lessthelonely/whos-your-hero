A major theme in all media. ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalTropes"] The villain or Ineffectual Loner mocks the idea of relying on others, insisting that friends make you weak and only fear brings servitude. Then they discover, to their extreme shock and dismay, that the hero and their True Companions really do stand up for each other, and this really does enable the hero to kick the crap out of the bad guy. The Aesop: Having friends makes you strong, being alone makes you weak. Even What You Are in the Dark can depend on your memory of your friends.
The moment The Power of Friendship becomes clear is A Friend in Need ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFriendInNeed"], but beware the Apple of Discord. When the loner has been brought into the group, Remember That You Trust Me may be needed to keep him attached.
More often than not a hero who makes good use of this power is going to attract villains who try to prove that it doesn't work. (The biggest reason is such villains rarely have any friends, as heroes occasionally point out.) After slugging it out with the hero one or more times ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship"] the villain in question may become a Friendly Enemy, a Worthy Opponent, or do a full on Heelâ€“Face Turn.
However, one seeking to use this power should be very wary of the few times it may not work; an antagonist with the sheer strength to back them up may be just as capable of tanking an attack powered by friendship, then using a counterattack of theirs that's so strong that it completely overpowers the hero and their allies ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold"].
A Combined Energy Attack ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinedEnergyAttack"] is another perk of believing in said power. Taken more literally, the Power of Friendship may be used as a required element of some magical effect, such as a Care-Bear Stare or a Circle of Friendship. Heroes, especially the Magnetic Hero, usually spend the first few episodes building this group of loyal followers. Sometimes it can go too far; Heroes fall prey to becoming a Martyr Without a Cause and allies could be False Friends. Contrast In the End, You Are on Your Own, in which case Friendship becomes less helpful. This trope is a key element of buddy pictures.
The Power of Friendship can be just as strong for the bad guys as for the good guys, but they seldom have enough common sense ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy"] to play it straight. When they do, expect a pretty wild ride, and a clash with The Remnant once the main conflict's over.

The risk of Sweetness Aversion or even Narm is present if done poorly. The Good King should be wary of this trope, it can turn into Nepotism (well, technically cronyism). If your characters are entirely reliant on their friends for any characterization or motivation, they will rapidly become Flat Characters.
In The Four Loves ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourLoves"], friendship is classified under Philia.
