...will become no better than the monsters he slays.
Something has happened to our Fallen Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero"]: his village was destroyed, his friends were killed, his puppy was roasted on an open spit, his bike was stolen, whatever. All that matters is that It's Personal, and he feels that the law just isn't suitable enough (or has become too corrupt and ignorant) to be of any use to him in settling the matter. He may justify his actions by claiming that it's justice he's after, not vengeance, but anyone with half a brain can easily see that he's out for revenge. Unfortunately, we can also see that the more he hunts the cause of his woes, the more he takes on the villain's personality and mannerisms — something that our so-called hero is too blinded by his single-minded goal to realize.
He Who Fights Monsters ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop"] is not quite a villain, but they act antagonistically enough that they're little better than a villain. He may have good intentions; he might have a point when he says that the fiend is too dangerous to be kept alive. Other characters within the work itself might even concede that point. But ultimately, his obsession with dealing out due punishment (or worse) and his refusal to think about what he's doing twists him into a monster just as bad as, or even worse than, the one he's hunting. And even before he gets to that point, it's nigh-impossible to turn him away; calling him out on it will be ignored or retaliated against. The Power of Friendship and The Power of Love were lost to him the moment the atrocity that sent him on his wild goose chase happened; he feels that Team Spirit is just a hindrance, and that Love Is a Weakness that he can't afford to have. Heel Realizations will be ignored or viewed as a moment of weakness to crush, and he will never have an "I've Come Too Far" or "No Place for Me There" moment. Those require insight which he just doesn't have. In fact, his views are utterly incorrigible; he's either a Tautological Templar or is very far down the road to becoming one, and he is utterly convinced of his own moral infallibility and the righteousness of his own cause. The more his quest drags on or throws up hurdles, the more likely it is that he'll forget just what his original mission even was, In fact, the further along in his quest he is, the more likely it is that he'll get a lot more dangerous due to how fast his list of targets can mushroom when he isn't entirely sure who his enemies are any more. Don't expect him to make a Heroic Sacrifice or Heel–Face Turn anytime soon; if he dies in the process of bringing his nemesis down, it's usually with him crossing into Villainstown in his moment of glory. If he doesn't die...
The "fighting monsters" line represents what is a recognizable Moral Event Horizon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon"] for heroes, and both Anti-Heroes and Well-Intentioned Extremists live just near the boundary, especially the more pitiless Good Is Not Nice, Unfettered, Pragmatic Hero types. Engaging in Van Helsing Hate Crimes is a good indicator of having crossed the boundary and a Knight Templar is most certainly beyond it.
A significant reason why this happens is the avenger's motivation. Those who seek justice are out to stop the villain from hurting any more people, because they don't want them to suffer like they have; and while they may be ruthless ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero"] about pursuing the villain (and may even be willing to kill the villain if they are dangerous enough), they're ultimately looking to benefit society, so long as they don't forget their cause. Meanwhile, those who seek revenge are out to make the villain suffer for what they did to them or those close to them, believing that what was done to them has given them the right to inflict pain in return. They're not looking to improve society; they're doing it for their own sake.
As expected, this twisted situation is very popular in the Revenge Tragedy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tragedy"] genre, especially because of its inherent Dramatic Irony. note Nietzsche himself was also inspired by Ancient Greek tragic antihero archetypes; see also his first book The Birth of Tragedy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tragedy"]. This trope can also be used to demonstrate how "eye-for-an-eye" justice, while sounding like sweet Karmic Equivalent Exchange Justice at first, can easily spiral out into utter chaos if the hero lets his passions, wrath, and Pride forgo rationality.
May be expressed through the page quote, or via the common misquote "When you become obsessed with the enemy, you become the enemy".
When they cross the line or vice versa, Redemption Equals Death ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath"] is the only solution for his Heel–Face Turn. This may lead to Alas, Poor Villain, if the one who fights monsters is an antagonist/a villain of a certain work.
Not to be confused with Complete Monster ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster"], although somebody can well become one by fighting such monsters. They can range from Anti-Hero to anywhere above. See also Cycle of Revenge, The Dark Side Will Make You Forget, Protagonist Journey to Villain, You Are What You Hate, Then Let Me Be Evil, and Became Their Own Antithesis. If this trope happens to a child, it can be used as a Freudian Excuse of a character who Used to Be a Sweet Kid. Compare And Then John Was a Zombie, where the character becomes a literal monster. If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him! is pretty much a sped-up version of this. Political equivalents are The Horseshoe Effect, Reign of Terror, Full-Circle Revolution, and Meet the New Boss. If the monster in question is an animal, that's Animal Nemesis. If the monster is supernatural, it's a decidedly unheroic instance of Hunter of Monsters. When this happens on a species wide scale, compare Humans Are the Real Monsters. Subtrope of Slowly Slipping Into Evil.
Revenge Is Not Justice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeIsNotJustice"] is more of a response that's invoked in an effort to stop the person from becoming a monster. If the person has become a monster, then Revenge Is Not Justice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeIsNotJustice"] is invoked to call them out for becoming a monster. Vigilante Injustice is often the starting point of a hero's descent into villainy as they have killed someone in self-defense or they killed the villain under the belief that it's the only way to get rid of a villain who's truly irredeemable.
Contrast The Chain of Harm ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainOfHarm"], when instead of going after the perpetrator, they will go after the easiest nearby target.
Not to be confused with Those Who Hunt Elves ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThoseWhoHuntElves"], or Monster Hunter. For the Rosario + Vampire fanfic, see He Who Fights Monsters (though this one is an example of this trope).
