This trope takes place when one character is thrown into the shoes of a dead man to experience his final moments. Either the player reads a pamphlet about Timmy's brutal slaying by a monster which then comes to try to kill the player, or he has to complete a dead man's task, witnessing and experiencing what killed the person before him.
