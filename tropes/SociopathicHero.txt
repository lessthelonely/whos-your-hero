They fight for the good guys. They might even believe in the cause ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralSociopathy"] (to a point). But they are a hero only in name.
They are Anti-Heroes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero"] who have a fundamental Lack of Empathy, a sociopathic disregard for their enemies' lives, and possibly a lack of concern for even the people they save. They may be motivated by boredom, a raw thirst for combat, or by some sort of carrot-and-stick arrangement — a chip in the head, an attachment to some person or thing that requires them to do good, or a pragmatic code that prevents them from landing in jail or in a shallow grave.
They may solve their problems in much the same way that a villain would — using ruthless methods to reach their goals. They may routinely torture, murder, and/or commit evil acts nearly as bad as the Big Bad ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad"]. They'll do whatever it takes to win. The people they fight beside are shocked with their behavior, but try to tell themselves, "At least they're on our side." Even that may not be true in the end, where it may be suggested that this "hero" has become as evil as the monsters they vanquished. And God help you if they decide to turn against you...
Common rationalizations either by the hero himself or on the hero's behalf include Asshole Victim ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim"], Utopia Justifies the Means, It's All About Me, or It's What I Do.
Compare Heroic Comedic Sociopath ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath"], for when this kind of behavior is Played for Laughs, and Token Evil Teammate, which they will be if they're a team player. They also tend to stay in Nominal Hero or Villain Protagonist territory. If a character is treated as an Ideal Hero despite being this, then this has been combined with a Designated Hero. If they're a truly bad person with evil desires but are simply doing a traditionally heroic job like police officer or firefighter, you've got an Evil Hero on your hands.
This trope can overlap with the Sociopathic Soldier ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier"] although there are just as many outright villainous examples, especially if the setting is war or a chaotic milieu. See also Moral Sociopathy.
