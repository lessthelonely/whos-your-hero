    <hero:tropeDescription>What's a writer to do when a minor character that they created for a show suddenly becomes much more popular than the other members of the cast ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse"]? Why, re-write them as a main character, of course! This is that character. Usually starring in a sitcom, the breakout character quickly grabs hold of the audience's attention and writers take advantage of this energy. Someone who was once a one-note C-character, such as a Satellite Character ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter"] or a Living Prop, becomes a central part of the regular cast. May begin with Promotion to Opening Titles if they aren't already there and often liable to lead to a Spin-Off, or be subject to becoming an Adaptational Badass. Sometimes, a breakout character becomes such because they fill a niche in the cast that wasn't previously filled or acts as an impressive foil to The Hero. It isn't always good, though. ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools"] Sometimes, if a breakout character gets too much screentime, they risk making the audience feel that the character is overexposed or worse, become a Scrappy or a Creator's Pet. Furthermore, other characters in the cast might be Demoted to Extra due to their reduced roles and screentime. This pitfall can be avoided if the breakout character is given an occasional break so other characters can get their stories told. As such, their fans will patiently wait for them to reappear in the story and be all the more excited when they do. Relatedly, this can sometimes result from Executive Meddling ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling"], as opposed to the will of the writer/director; The Fonz himself, our poster boy, was an example, as his increasing prominence was inspired in part by executive pressure, and said execs even wanted to rename the show Fonzie's Happy Days at one point. Naturally, like a lot of executive decisions over creators, this can backfire spectacularly and cause a popular character to crater from over-exposure. Trying to intentionally make a breakout character before they're even introduced to audiences can also lead to some unfortunate results ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling"]. It might also be the reason why someone becomes an Adaptational Protagonist. When a character gets a larger, but still supporting, role because of the fanbase, that is simply an Ensemble Dark Horse ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse"], which they also are even if they don't get any increased role. Ascended Extra is when a character gains any sort of increased role regardless of the character's popularity (or lack thereof). When a character simply takes over the existing show, see Spotlight-Stealing Squad. Also see Breakout Villain ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutVillain"], a Sub-Trope for villain characters, and Iconic Sequel Character, a Sub-Trope for when the breakout character in question doesn't appear until a sequel. Compare to Breakup Breakout and Decoy Protagonist. Contrast The Artifact. No relation to Breakout. The line between this and Ensemble Dark Horse ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse"] can sometimes seem thin, and one may wonder why this isn't a YMMV trope when the latter is one. The key difference is this: the popularity of the character has to have influenced the direction of the narrative and put them into a major role, or led to the creation of new content specifically for them. That's what makes this a narrative and production trope; the influence of the character in the zeitgeist was so strong it actively, and quantitatively, influenced the production of the work. Otherwise, the character is just popular, which is often up for more debate in terms of degree, which is why Ensemble Dark Horse ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse"] is a YMMV trope.</hero:tropeDescription>
