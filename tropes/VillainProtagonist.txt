An interesting twist on conventional storytelling: make the bad guy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad"], or a bad guy, the main character.
Sometimes (but not always), this villainous main character will even get the Sympathetic P.O.V. ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticPOV"] On the other hand, it is not necessary for a villain to be sympathetic for them to be this trope. They simply need to be a villain whose morally reprehensible actions (however well-intentioned) are in no way glossed over or justified within the context of the story. We are seeing the story from a villain's point of view. Villain Protagonists are also common in Evil vs. Evil stories, where their nemesis is a Villain Antagonist.
A Villain Protagonist (especially in a comedy) is quite likely to go down in flames at the end. Whether this counts as a Downer Ending ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding"] or not generally depends on how many dogs they kick along the way, how entertaining their Humiliation Conga or Karmic Death is or both. They may also do a Heel–Face Turn and become a Hero Protagonist (or at least an Anti-Villain). This doesn't necessarily mean they will lose or perform a Heel–Face Turn. In fact, their status as a main character just makes it more likely that the story will end with the villain winning than any other story would.
When this is done for one episode, it's a Villain Episode ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainEpisode"].
This trope very often overlaps with a Nominal Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero"] and/or Sociopathic Hero, and sometimes with the more extreme cases of an Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonist. Note that they do not necessarily have to be the Big Bad — a Villain Protagonist can, and often does, deal with cases where they are the victim of some other villain rather than the aggressor and try to survive like anyone else would, but in order to be considered a Sociopathic Hero or a Heroic Comedic Sociopath as well, their struggle has to protect other victims of their enemy; it doesn't matter if they care at all about them or if any good that comes out of it is purely coincidental. Actually, authors may find that it is easier to write a story where the antagonist makes the plot rather than the villain, which means that a villainous protagonist is often just as passive and reactive to other characters' actions as a more traditional heroic protagonist. In fact, it is rather rare for a Villain Protagonist to be the villain of a story, presumably because audiences still want to root for the protagonist. It can still easily result in Too Bleak, Stopped Caring if handled poorly, or if the Protagonist is too Villainous. If this is a comedy where empathy isn't important, however, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.
Very often leads to Misaimed Fandom ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom"]. Do not confuse with the Anti-Hero, who lacks traditional heroic qualities and may have some unheroic ones, and may be more morally ambiguous, but is still ultimately on the side of good (although an Anti-Hero can end up becoming a Villain Protagonist if they end up crossing one too many lines). Also not to be confused with Byronic Hero, who is simply a deeply flawed person, heroic or not. Many Byronic Heroes tend to zone in and out of Villain Protagonist territory, though. If the main character is the villain to themselves in their own story, they are His Own Worst Enemy. If a heroic protagonist is revealed to be Evil All Along towards the end, this is The Killer in Me. If you get to see how a heroic protagonist gradually becomes evil over the course of the story, this is Protagonist Journey to Villain.
It is vanishingly rare for these characters to be a Complete Monster ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster"], as regardless of how much a bad dude a protagonist may be, the audience will generally still desire to have at least a degree of relatability and sympathy for them, although it has happened in very rare circumstances, often in stand-alone and experimental works. Very rarely, they might even show up in serialized series, which can lead to Too Bleak, Stopped Caring unless executed in a very careful fashion and are usually counterbalanced by either making it a He Who Fights Monsters story or adding a sympathetic Deuteragonist who shares near-equal screen time.
Contrast Hero Antagonist ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist"], both in terms of morality and role in the story. Compare and contrast Villain Antagonist and Hero Protagonist. Do not mix up with Vanilla Protagonist, unless this particular villain is meant to emphasize how evil the other villains in the main cast are.
