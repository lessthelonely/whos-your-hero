If a status effect has both a positive and negative impact, it's usually done to balance out its utility to keep it from being overpowered. For example, if an effect raises your attack, it may lower your defense to compensate. Some games may allow you to "cure" this status, but if the effect both helps and hinders a player, they may think twice about using a status-healing item or ability. Some recurring examples include the Berserk status, which usually raises the target's attack power in exchange for making them uncontrollable, or the Sleep status, which typically immobilizes the target but may restore their HP/MP over time.
Keep in mind that status effects are temporary, which means they only last for a limited period of time, for the duration of a battle/level, or at least until the target takes damage or cures the status with an item or ability. If it's something that can be equipped like armor or lasts indefinitely, then it's not this trope. If the drawback is that it can be replaced with another then it's Discard and Draw ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscardAndDraw"]. Also, if the only downside is "you lose the buff if you perform a certain action or take damage" then it doesn't count.
Compare Power at a Price ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice"], except in that case, the effect lasts for an indeterminate amount of time, while a status effect is only temporary, and Diverting Power, where multiple systems share one limited power source. Also compare Stance System and Multiform Balance, where different forms have different strengths and weaknesses, but the effect can last for as long as the user wants. A Cast from Hit Points buff can qualify as this if it's activated by the user. A Booze-Based Buff also sometimes qualifies as this depending on the game. See also One Curse Limit, where having one negative status effect prevents being inflicted with another.
