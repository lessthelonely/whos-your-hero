    <hero:tropeDescription>Like building an Evil Tower of Ominousness ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTowerOfOminousness"] or wielding a BFS or BFG, there are just some things that have to make other characters wonder if a male character must be compensating for certain other inadequacies. Despite the joke, sometimes bigger really is better ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetter"], in a non-Freudian way, especially in fights. In these cases, you're not Compensating for Something, you're sane. Usually. Theorized by some ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsJesusInPurgatory"] to be the reason Heroes Prefer Swords. If you actually have a small penis ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenyWeenie"], it would unfortunately make you an Acceptable Target. See also Phallic Weapon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhallicWeapon"], Mid-Life Crisis Car. This can be Gender-Inverted, though rarely, if a woman is trying to compensate for something like A-Cup Angst by padding her breasts to invoke Buxom Beauty Standard or a ticking Biological Clock. And of course, a similar phenomenon can occur with male or female examples of The Napoleon, who often try to compensate for lack of inches in a different context (cf. Small Girl, Big Gun). The examples are limited to In-Universe ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse"]. Please do not add your own speculations.</hero:tropeDescription>
