    <hero:tropeDescription>The Ancient Conspiracy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy"] is nearly ready to make their big move and conquer the world. Their mad scientists have perfected a new and incomprehensibly powerful form of Applied Phlebotinum that will overpower any conventional armies that stand in their way. There's just one small problem... ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight"] Either Even if the beneficiary of the phlebotinum is not initially opposed to the conspiracy, it won't be long before they Kick the Dog ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog"] or otherwise cross the line in their efforts to get their technology back. Thus, in the ultimate show of irony, the Phlebotinum Rebel is born: A Person of Mass Destruction ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction"], given power by the bad guys themselves and destined to be the only person capable of defeating them. Bravo, Evil Overlords. While phlebotinum is usually a Forgotten Superweapon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenSuperweapon"] or Disposable Superhero Maker that cannot be replicated by the good guys, villain-developed versions may very well remain active throughout the show in order to provide the hero with evil counterparts that share their power. The reason the hero is able to prevail varies: Faustian Rebellion ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaustianRebellion"] is a variant. Entire groups of such rebels may result from Guinea Pig Family and Secret Project Refugee Family. Sub-Trope to Pro-Human Transhuman. The more heroic types of Super-Soldier often have this for their Back Story. Often the result of Playing with Syringes. This can be a way to Create Your Own Hero or Create Your Own Villain depending on the case. A particularly unlucky example will also be a Phlebotinum Muncher or Flawed Prototype. Most cases of this are preceded with a particularly obvious What Could Possibly Go Wrong?. A Grand Theft Prototype is when the phlebotinum is stolen by another faction as opposed to going rogue itself. Related to Escaped from the Lab.</hero:tropeDescription>
