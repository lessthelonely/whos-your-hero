    <hero:tropeDescription>When two (or ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeWaySex"] mor ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeWaySex"]e) people have psychic sex, from beaming sensual pleasures to each other, to copulating in a dreamscape of their minds' creation. This rarely leads to physical consequences as it would in the real world, since it happens in the Astral Plane, unless ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButICantBePregnant"] Your Mind Makes It Real. Emotional matters are a different story, since it is otherwise no different from a physical affair. Some forms of Mind Control ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl"] and Mental Fusion might eerily feel like this. Gives Jedi Mind Trick ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JediMindTrick"] an entirely different ring, doesn't it? On the less sci-fi side: yes, most people are guilty of the one-sided version of this at some time in their life. Also, some religions consider it to be a sin. Of course, not to be confused with Mind Screw ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew"] or Mind Rape, though there's a strong possibility of overlap with the latter. A sister trope of the less sexual Dream Walker ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWalker"] and Talking in Your Dreams.</hero:tropeDescription>
