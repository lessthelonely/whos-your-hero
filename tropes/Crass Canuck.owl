    <hero:tropeDescription>The most common stereotype of people from the great white north land of Canada ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Canada"] is that they are nice, polite, and apologetic to a fault, with American works depicting Canada ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Canada"] as a Quirky Neighbor Country (with its own trope). Not these people ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellThisIsNotThatTrope"]. Some Canadians brush off the pleasantries, have no time to talk aboot the weather or any other small talk. In fact, they're just as cold as their weather, and don't give two craps about politeness, their apologies have a snarky tone to them, more so when interacting with their Yankee neighbors, Heaven forbid if they're mistaken for their Yankee neighbors, and they are The Dreaded in the likes of ice hockey or warfare by their rivals. Double points if they're from QuebecnoteÂ Usually downplayed in French media when French-Canadians show up, as the accent sounds inherently silly rather than crass to metropolitan French speakers. or Alberta, as both tend to be stereotyped as a Lower-Class Lout region similarly to America's Deep South. Of course, being a rude Canadian doesn't necessarily mean evil; they can be honest and can see the bullcrap, with a passive-aggressive or Affably Evil ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil"] Canadian being a foil to the character.
