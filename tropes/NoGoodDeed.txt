We all know that karma ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Karma"] can be a harsh but fair bitch, but sometimes it's just a total bitch. It's not enough that the bad guy is a Karma Houdini. It's not enough that the good guy Can't Get Away with Nuthin'. It's not even enough that he's a Butt-Monkey or The Chew Toy, put through the wringer for no reason. No, sometimes fate isn't satisfied until disaster befalls the good guy purely as a result of him doing the right thing.
If this happens because the hero helps people who are ungrateful ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard"], it can be a case of All of the Other Reindeer or The Farmer and the Viper. If this happens because the hero doesn't want unnecessary violence, it can be a case of Pacifism Backfire. More often, helping out exposes the hero to some other danger, like the wrath of a villain whose plans were disrupted by the good deed, or the wrath of a populace that is opposed to the method of help, such as in many Burn the Witch! stories that involve actual witches, or being Arrested for Heroism. Or being targeted by people who assume you have Chronic Hero Syndrome and so will be glad to help them for free. On the other hand, it can also happen to a villain making a Sudden Principled Stand or showing that Even Evil Has Standards.
Not every hero can handle this, and if it happens often enough or particularly badly enough, a hero may very well ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil"] fall. If they stick it through even to the end, knowing what's coming to them, it shows who they are in the dark.
It should also be noted that this trope is more complicated than it looks. Sometimes good intentions bring unjust punishment, but sometimes good intentions result in very bad results because the good-intentioned person was also foolish, incompetent, ignorant, or just mistaken. In many cases whether a bad outcome was undeserved or not depends on the details.
As Robert Heinlein's character Lazarus Long observes in one story, "Good intentions are no substitute for knowing how the buzzsaw works." Which doesn't mean that life is not often cruelly unjust, it merely means that things are often not as simple as they look at first glance.
Named for a well-known saying attributed to Clare Boothe Luce. The Wide-Eyed Idealist ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist"] is prone to this, and tends to turn them into a Knight in Sour Armor at best. Very often, it is a consequence of doing Not Quite the Right Thing. Sometimes results from Sparing the Final Mook, if it turns out that said mook is either a Not-So-Harmless Villain or has some other way to cause misery for the good guys. Compare Being Good Sucks, where it's the act of being good (rather than the deeds themselves) that brings suffering, and contrast Laser-Guided Karma where every deed (good or otherwise) gets paid back in spades. If someone sees a hero going through this, it may lead to Sympathy for the Hero. Compare Androcles' Lion and Character Witness, two Tropes that can prove the exact opposite.
By its very nature, it frequently overlaps with Nice Job Breaking It, Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero"], though it's entirely possible for this to result from a deed that doesn't, in and of itself, have bad consequences.
