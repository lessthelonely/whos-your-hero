    <hero:tropeDescription>She is the Ice Queen ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen"]: cool, reserved, and giving nothing away. She may want love as ardently as anyone, but she masks her soft heart behind a wall of ice. It is up to someone else, typically her Love Interest, to soften her cold demeanor and win her love. (Substitute "Ice King" if more applicable.) "Cold demeanor" can mean anything from Rich Bitch ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch"], to haughty and proud, to Emotionless Girl, to being a Jerkass. Occasionally, she has — legitimately or not — misunderstood her Love Interest or companion. Furthermore, she will work with them and be professional enough for the task, if through some gritted teeth. Over the story, the other person successfully melts the Ice Queen's cold heart, giving her Character Development into a nicer character. Her Dark and Troubled Past will often be subject of a Somber Backstory Revelation, usually to The Defroster. Typically, the payoff comes When She Smiles and shows he's gotten through to her. Usually it's a romance story that is Wish-Fulfillment ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishFulfillment"] for both men ("That girl doesn't hate me, she's just waiting for me to prove my love is true.") or women ("A warm and caring man will fall in love with me and bring me fulfillment and happiness."). Occasionally it's not romantic, instead being a buddy tale of The Power of Friendship. Either way it can be a morality tale. Sometimes the defroster is a faker, who now breaks the former Ice Queen ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen"]'s heart, sending her back into her shell, but then sometimes the faker ends up subjected to Becoming the Mask, and decides they like the Ice Queen ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen"] (or King) after all. The reversal of gender roles in this trope is common; see All Girls Want Bad Boys ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys"] about the female fantasy of reforming a heartless man. Compare: Jerk with a Heart of Gold ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold"], Jerkass Woobie, Broken Bird, Lady of War, Sugar-and-Ice Personality, Took a Level in Kindness, Took a Level in Cheerfulness, and Took a Level in Idealism. Overlaps with Morality Pet. Don't You Dare Pity Me! may come into play in the early stages. Platonic examples may intersect with certain variations of Rude Hero, Nice Sidekick.</hero:tropeDescription>
