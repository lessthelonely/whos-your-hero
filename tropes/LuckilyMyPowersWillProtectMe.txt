The comic book variation on Expospeak ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expospeak"].
Comic books are, in general, a serial medium, and you can't rely on someone reading one issue to have read all the previous issues. Thus, there needs to be a way to inform the reader about the characters and the plot up to this point.
One common way to do this is to simply drop the relevant information into the character's speech bubbles. If done well, it'll feel natural and unforced; unfortunately, it's usually done as something along the lines of "Luckily My Powers Will Protect Me ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop"] from the harmful radiations of the unshielded uranium that The Professor wanted me to pick up from these abandoned South American mines!"
This tends to be even more offputting than regular Expospeak ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expospeak"], since the characters are speaking to no one in particular. A less-jarring variation is putting the exposition in thought bubbles, but that's surprisingly uncommon.
This began as a stylistic choice in the early age of comics in which every single panel was accompanied by a piece of narrative text. The primary advantage of this was that it allowed the authors to create faster stories without having to visually depict every single step of a process. At the time, it was not unusual for a single issue to have more than one complete story in a format which modern audiences would complain is too short. As comics evolved, it became more common for story arcs to be spread over the course of many issues. This allowed artists to draw the entire sequence of events rather than rely on narrative explanation.
The original audiences may have found this less jarring, because at the time it was very common for radio drama characters to narrate everything they saw (given the lack of a visual medium).
In modern times, this has largely been abandoned. Readers are expected to be familiar with the characters or use the internet to fill in their knowledge gaps. More recently ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheModernAgeOfComicBooks"], introductory text pages at the beginning of the issue have come into fashion. Also, fans can just look up whatever the character can do online these days, anyways. Even if it's someone really obscure like Stiltman. (But then, perhaps surprisingly, his name pretty much says it all. He was a pretty lame villain. You can read about him on the Internet.)
If a character explains their powers directly to an opponent, it's Explaining Your Power to the Enemy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplainingYourPowerToTheEnemy"]. Not to be confused with Luckily, My Shield Will Protect Me.
May overlap with Talking Is a Free Action ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction"], when the character shouldn't have enough real time before danger hits to discourse about their powers.
