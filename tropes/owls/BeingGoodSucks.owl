    <hero:tropeDescription>If being good were as easy as most cartoons make it out to be, everyone would be a saint. The difficult truth is ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop"], sometimes Being Good Sucks. Doing the right thing doesn't always feel good ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood"], is hard to pull off, can be painful, sometimes even harmful, to yourself and others. Being good requires a Heroic Sacrifice, keeping your word, and thinking of others before yourself. It means swallowing your pride, owning up to and apologizing for your mistakes. It means doing the above without expecting a reward (even a spoken thank you), refusing one if offered—and most ego-crushing—accepting the punishment for being good. The variations are endless, but below is a condensed catalog: At times, it can lock characters into Status Quo Is God ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod"], where success requires an evil action, making winning and staying good impossible. On the other side of the fence, this crops up when Evil Feels Good ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFeelsGood"]. Often applies to a Heel–Face Turn character or a hero who laments that they have to save somebody they hate from a burning building, or they don't get to kill their most hated enemy because that's the "heroic" decision. In a Crapsack World ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld"], this trope applies to a great degree but being anything in such a world generally sucks. Contrast ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeTropes"] Good Feels Good and Being Evil Sucks. Also, see Downer Ending, or, if you're lucky, Earn Your Happy Ending. Compare No Good Deed Goes Unpunished, where the good action (rather than the process of being good) is what gets the characters in trouble. May result in someone expressing Sympathy for the Hero. Contrast ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeTropes"] Karma Houdini Warranty, where trying to turn over a new leaf can bring down heaven's wrath. This is one way people become an Iron Woobie or a Knight in Sour Armor, depending on whether the suffering is taken with quiet dignity or grumpy complaining. This belief is the original mentality of a Moral Pragmatist before a Heel–Face Turn or someone tries to Cut Lex Luthor a Check, but they may wind up here again if they're proven right. A common justification for believing this is Virtue Is Weakness. See also It Sucks to Be the Chosen One for when someone has to do this Because Destiny Says So. There are many instances in real life in which being 'good' doesn't suck that much. Scientifically, deeds perceived as good - whether or not they are good - entail social recognition and approval, and bad deeds entail reprisal. Most villains or villainous groups might also view their actions as 'good' in some sense, however, and therefore it might be unclear that this counts as 'good' in the same sense as a story with an author-determined moral compass. Justice is one of the fundamental evolutionary imperatives that allows human society to function coherently; we may not all be saints, but we're not all lawless murderers. Unless you're a Villain with Good Publicity ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity"] It's usually more profitable to abide by society's rules, and even in that case, you could be best off being Affably Evil. However, the more you could influence perception in such a context, the less it would matter here whether or not you were evil. Of course, multiple societies might have different and often conflicting moral codes, even within their own confines; further, if people like Karl Marx (himself a 'villain' to some, but not all) are to be believed, the conflict within societies can sometimes be such as to give rise to fundamentally opposed forces and force recourse to struggle. Further, moral codes change over time, and this occasionally leads to conflicts between earlier morality and new trends. As a result, a simplistic application of the story-telling categories of 'villains' and 'heroes' from fiction to real-life might be worth avoiding, when it comes to this trope.</hero:tropeDescription>
