    <hero:tropeDescription>In fiction, the audience is conditioned to become invested in effort; after all, a fight where the characters go through the motions is boring. Thus, this law exists to ensure that the more effort an ability requires, the stronger it is. If you're the good guys, at least. Heroes need a handicap, after all. ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DavidVersusGoliath"] Note that there are two distinct, somewhat contradictory but not mutually exclusive, ways to use this trope. In the first, a set of powers or single ability which requires more effort to use is often going to be more powerful than one that requires less, for reasons of narrative Competitive Balance ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitiveBalance"]. In addition, characters may be able to boost their own power levels by putting more effort into it, in a sort of willpower-based version of Tim Taylor Technology. On the flip side, a character who displays less effort using their abilities can safely be assumed to be scarily badass, for reasons similar to the logic behind The Law of Diminishing Defensive Effort. The former generally applies to heroes and the latter to villains, but exceptions do exist. Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] of Power at a Price and Difficult, but Awesome. The middle-of-the-road tiers may cause a Psychic Nosebleed. Ki Manipulation almost have to follow this trope implicitly, because Ki is based on focus, physical health, and willpower. See also The Law of Diminishing Defensive Effort when it comes to using defensive efforts(or lack thereof). Compare Cooldown ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cooldown"] for when the price comes after usage, but can still use this scale. Compare Spell Construction for the kind of efforts you have to make to perform magic feats.</hero:tropeDescription>
