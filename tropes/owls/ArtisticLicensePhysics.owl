    <hero:tropeDescription>Writers often play fast and loose with physics —sometimes intentionally, sometimes not. This is usually acceptable when it makes for good storytelling and/or just plain awesomeness ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool"], and one should always keep the MST3K Mantra in mind. However, an egregious violation of the laws of physics can result in loss of Willing Suspension of Disbelief, especially in a story that tries to be taken seriously, or if the error could have been avoided with minimal revision. When this is done properly, it can make for awesome action sequences and way-cool visuals —think The Dark Knight ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight"] or BioShock, for example. Done badly, it can ruin the atmosphere entirely. Some scientifically-minded individuals have a website devoted specifically to detailing these failings in movies: Insultingly Stupid Movie Physics. ["https://tvtropes.orghttp://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/"] Soft science fiction uses Artistic License ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense"] for physics extensively, as do many video games, war films, and horror movies. Hard science fiction uses it too, but will often provide an in-universe explanation that goes beyond "it just does." There will often be some give or take to make up for the conservation of momentum or energy involved, which often makes for an interesting puzzle or workaround for the characters. Often lampshaded ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging"] with the line "How Is That Even Possible?". Sometimes people think this trope is applied when Reality Is Unrealistic ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic"]. A Sister Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SisterTrope"] to Artistic License – Biology, Artistic License – Chemistry, and Cartoon Physics (which fit Rule of Funny more than Rule of Cool).
