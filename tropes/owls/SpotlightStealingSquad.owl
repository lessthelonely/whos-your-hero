    <hero:tropeDescription>Most works have a main character or a set of main characters who are supposed to be the main focus of the story. But sometimes this changes. An actor might give such a set of performances that they will dominate whatever scene they're in; the creator might have such a connection, conscious or unconscious, with a side character or group ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet"] that he or she forgets that they have an incredibly diverse and powerful main cast; or the characters that supposedly should have the focus might just be uninteresting. If left unchecked, this may lead fans to complain about how They Wasted a Perfectly Good Plot ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot"], let the less fantastic characters fall behind, never did anything with Hufflepuff House, and Jossed everyone's ships. Most commonly happens to the Ensemble Dark Horse ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse"] if lucky and the Creator's Pet if not. This trope can, in fact, overlap with the Creator's Pet ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet"] or Replacement Scrappy. The main difference is that the SSS is not necessarily hated (at least, not at first), in fact, they may be or become one of the most popular characters. Compare Wolverine Publicity, and contrast Out of Focus. If the fanbase agrees (or the marketing team does, at any rate), may lead to a Spotlight-Stealing Title. May become a Breakout Character if they are adored by the audience. See also Adored by the Network, for spotlight-stealing shows, or Poorly-Disguised Pilot if the squad consists of new characters that are never seen again. See also Spotlight-Stealing Crossover for crossover works, when its characters or elements from one particular work that are given more prominence over other works in the crossover. NOTE: A friendly reminder that Tropes Are Tools ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools"] â€” there are times where the viewers actually like the spotlight hog. Finally, remember, neither the protagonist nor the deuteragonist can be part of the spotlight-stealing squad. The story is about them, after all. See also Decoy Protagonist, which occurs when someone replaces an apparent protagonist in the role.</hero:tropeDescription>
