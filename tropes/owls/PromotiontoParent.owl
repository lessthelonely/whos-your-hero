    <hero:tropeDescription>    A side effect of Parental Abandonment ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment"] that occurs when the trope applies to siblings. The first born takes over the role of parentâ€”enforcing the rules, setting curfews, delivering lectures, and bringing home the paycheck. They may be doing the parents' job, but they are still a brother or sister to everyone else, and will probably get into conflict with their siblings over how much power they should have and how much respect they deserve, depending on the ages of the younger ones, and the status of the original parents (i.e. missing/dead/villains...). The parents may have even specifically asked their eldest child to Take Care of the Kids. On a positive note, the sibling-parent is usually within the Competence Zone ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone"], and will be understanding if you have to Wake Up, Go to School, Save the World. If they get Trapped in Another World themselves, they'll expect to be fully responsible for their charges' safety, even to the point of Heroic Sacrifice. Becoming a sibling-parent often makes a child Wise Beyond Their Years. Truth in Television ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"], although it's more common on the frontiers of civilization and when families were larger and more spread out in ages. (Westerns make use of this a lot.) Sometimes the oldest kid of a one-parent family tries to take some responsibility off the parent too. If this takes place on a society-wide level, it's a Teenage Wasteland ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenageWasteland"]: the strongest of the survivors, where "strongest" usually equals "oldest", end up taking the younger survivors under their wings, forming pseudo-familial units in which the older kids are the "parents" and the younger ones are "children". Smaller-scale versions include the plane crash that strands a family while killing or incapacitating the parents and the Neverland scenario, in which a bunch of kids have run away from home or are otherwise isolated. In some rare instances, there are still adults around but children get drafted as a Parental Substitute ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute"] because of some combination of importance, dangerousness and difficulty. This is generally because only those of "pure heart" or some such can do it, and adults are too corrupted. Thus, this variant is most likely to have the cut-off be puberty. It's kind of the opposite of the Puberty Superpower, with plenty of angst as the kids age towards the cut-off and/or their ability to perform their job wanes with increasing age. In some cases, it's just that the adults are too incompetent to handle the job or the family is just that big, and thus the eldest children end up having to back up Mom and Dad. This trope can also apply to adults. For instance, when someone childless (likely a man) finds out of the blue that he has a child he didn't know about ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeYouAreMyFather"]. This usually can range from the traditional accidental conception ("I'm your daughter/son.") to the sci-fi clone. Another way would be when a woman finds out she is pregnant and has to step up to being a parent whether or not she is ready for it yet. Still another, when a swinging bachelor/bachelorette uncle/aunt is unexpectedly saddled with guardianship of a nephew/niece. This trope is almost always present in a Badass and Child Duo ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAndChildDuo"]. Compare to Big Brother Instinct ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct"], Family Man, Extremely Protective Child, And Your Reward Is Parenthood. If this trope is a Klingon Promotion to parent, the promoted will also be a Self-Made Orphan. Contrast with Disappointing Older Sibling when the first born proves to be too immature, irresponsible, or ineffectual to be a parental substitute. Playing House is when it's just a game kids play. Sister ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun"] trope to Unexpected Successor and You Are in Command Now.</hero:tropeDescription>
