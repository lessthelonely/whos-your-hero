    <hero:tropeDescription>An older sibling is usually supposed to serve as a positive example for their younger sibling. However, a good amount of the time, the younger sibling will view them as an example of how not to behave ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiRoleModel"]. In fiction, the older sibling is often portrayed as being more lazy, reckless, and all around more of a troublemaker than their younger sibling. Usually an older brother will serve this role to a younger sister ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser"], though this isn't always the case. The younger sibling may find the antics of their older sibling endearing, or annoying (or both). The older sibling, especially those who exhibit Manchild behavior, can also simply cause them to be wrapped into a bad situation that gets them both in trouble. This doesn't mean the younger sibling is perfect. They may be willing to get into childish acts, or perhaps the younger sibling is at an opposite extreme. Regardless, the younger sibling tends to be the more mature of the two. This can be Played for Drama where the older sibling feels inferior when compared to their younger sibling. However, despite their usual immaturity, there may be times where the older sibling shows that their younger sibling can rely on them in a pinch. Compare with Disappointing Older Sibling ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappointingOlderSibling"] (which is about younger siblings having a negative opinion of their older siblings, regardless of why or how justified it is), Foolish Sibling, Responsible Sibling and Aloof Big Brother (which is about the (usually male) sibling being cold and distant towards his younger siblings). Also compare Wacky Parent, Serious Child, which is a similar dynamic applied to parents and their children. Not to be confused with Big Little Brother, where the younger sibling is physically larger than the older sibling, though the two may overlap. Contrast Mature Younger Sibling and Annoying Younger Sibling.</hero:tropeDescription>
