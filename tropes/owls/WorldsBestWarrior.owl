    <hero:tropeDescription>This is the character who can, with little argument, mop the floor with just about anyone or anything. There are a couple of ways to utilize this trope: Sometimes overlaps with World's Strongest Man ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan"], especially when brute force or sheer firepower are what decides combat strength. The first variation of this trope typically appears in competitions, such as a martial arts, boxing, or wrestling, where combatants would be subject to a great many rules, as well as gender and weight restrictions. The second variation is extremely common in Sh≈çnen, where Power Levels indicate combat capabilities and fighting spirit. See also The Greatest Style, which this character probably uses, or at least knows how to beat. Frequently overlaps with Master Swordsman and Master Archer for their respective weapons. If this character actually does lose to someone, they are usually a Superior Successor ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSuccessor"] and are instantly promoted to the new #1 spot. This character is either the winner (or a main antagonist) in a Tournament Arc, a Combat by Champion or when There Can Be Only One. Due to these factors they may face The Perils of Being the Best. In works where the hero is going To Be a Master, the person who fits this trope would be the biggest challenge in achieving their goal. Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] of "World's Best" Character by being that, but for just martial feats. In Arrogant God vs. Raging Monster, one of them tends to be this.</hero:tropeDescription>
