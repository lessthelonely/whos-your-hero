    <hero:tropeDescription>One of the standards of sexual prowess for a guy, at least in fiction, is how long sex with him can be expected to last. Thus, a male character's real or alleged inability to maintain a Raging Stiffie ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagingStiffie"] long enough for it to provide much pleasure for his partner is a frequent subject for insults, gossip, or self-deprecating humor. Sometimes it has implications of selfishness (if the guy is only interested in his own orgasm and assumes sex is over once it's happened) or inexperience/ineptitude (premature ejaculation also features often here) followed by a swift cry afterwards. Men might Think Unsexy Thoughts during the act to delay their orgasm. While this can be a problem for men in Real Life ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife"], it tends to be exaggerated in fiction, mostly for purpose of comedy. You may also find numerous references to "seven minutes" out there in trope land. Rest assured; seven minutes is actually the median time for an act of human sexual congress, but that doesn't mean a session can't last more than seven minutes! Something that can be just as much of a problem—but rarely gets depicted in fiction—is an inversion when a guy can keep going and going without ever reaching an orgasm himself ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anorgasmia"], no matter how hard he tries. In that case, a guy can get discouraged with sex, and worry that this inability to climax from sex with his partner will hurt their feelings. It is a more common problem for male virgins who have a lot of prior experience with masturbation: they find that actual sex feels different, and that two-way communication is required to figure out an arrangement that pushes the right buttons. Note that Speed Sex is the norm for many animals, particularly prey species that can't afford to leave themselves vulnerable to attack for longer than a few seconds. For example, chimpanzees and gorillas both only have sex for about thirty seconds. The reason humans last so much longer than their closest cousins is because it's a different sexual strategy, which also explains the differences in our penis shapes and testicle sizes. Humans have the largest penis, chimps have the largest testicles, and gorillas are the smallest in both. Their penises are also pointy where humans have a bulbous head. Gorilla males compete to make sure they're the father by maintaining a harem and preventing other males from having access to sex with them, hence no need for much semen. Chimpanzees have large colonies with parity among the sexes, so the competition occurs inside the vagina, with chimps pumping out copious volumes of semen to flush out their competitors and leave a plug to prevent others doing the same. Meanwhile, human penises act as pumps to scoop out competitor's stuff (which takes a lot of time), but we hope to prevent a competitor doing the same so we need more volume than gorillas. Compare The Loins Sleep Tonight ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoinsSleepTonight"] for when he can't get it up in the first place and Lousy Lovers Are Losers for when someone is an overall unsatisfying lover. If the couple decides to do something else sexual instead, check Technical Virgin. A man ejaculating before he can even get his clothes off is Jizzed in My Pants.</hero:tropeDescription>
