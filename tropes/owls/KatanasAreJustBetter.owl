    <hero:tropeDescription>Rule of Cool ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool"] says swords are cooler than guns and tends to also hold the Japanese katana to be the coolest of all swords. Japanese media often lionize the katana, and Westerners with a Foreign Culture Fetish or belief in Exotic Weapon Supremacy take this reputation even further. Because of this widespread cult of katana supremacy, putting one in the hands of a character is often a statement that they are cooler and more powerful than the ones who don't have one. The katana is usually characterized as an Absurdly Sharp Blade ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySharpBlade"] that can make a Clean Cut straight through just about anything, maybe even so clean that the object doesn't fall apart until a few seconds afterwards. A character with a katana is usually a Master Swordsman with Implausible Fencing Powers. Even more so than other heroes wielding swords, shooting at this guy is usually pointless unless you want your bullets parried. Basic laws of physics need not apply. Of course, in reality, katana are no better or worse than most any other type of sword. They were designed to function best within their own time period and culture, just as any sword. See the analysis page ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/KatanasAreJustBetter"] for more on that front. We also have a Useful Notes page on Swords for more information, as well as a Kenjutsu on the real martial arts associated with their use. It seems possible that this will eventually become a Discredited Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope"]. Since the 2010s or so it has become far less universal in popular culture, and excessive boasts about the katana are frequently debunked or parodied online. However, despite the fact that its physical performance is not exaggerated as frequently, the katana is still pretty widely considered to be especially cool and stylish. See also Suave Sabre which is a western variation on curved swords. A Super-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTrope"] to Wooden Katanas Are Even Better, in which the ultimate sign of a Master Swordsman in Japan is being able to defeat a steel katana using a wooden one.</hero:tropeDescription>
