    <hero:tropeDescription>The moment when a character realizes that something awful has happened, or notices that something awful is about to happen, and screams "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" ["https://tvtropes.orghttps://theuselessweb.site/nooooooooooooooo/"] It can also be used when a character angrily refuses to do something. If the character is rushing to prevent the something-awful from happening, a slow-motion effect can be employed to draw out the tension of the moment, sometimes to the point of drawing out the "No" into a comical bass growl. This trope is very susceptible to becoming Narm ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm"], but does raise the question of exactly how a character should handle a crisis without coming off as a psychotic (by going catatonic), a monster (by cracking a grim joke), or a potty-mouth (by swearing one's head off). Used both seriously and for comic effect. Very common on sitcoms. Sometimes the Big "NO!" ends the episode with a Cliffhanger ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger"]. Nearing the point of becoming Narm ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm"] and a Discredited Trope, though a good actor can still pull it off. Some variants still have credibility, including a shorter but still intense "No", and a panicked "No no no no no!" Or you can just go for the simpler Skyward Scream. Occasionally the character will shout something other than "No!" — usually shouting the name of the character that something bad is about to happen or has just happened to. This is slightly less discredited. On the whole, however, this trope is usually a reliable indicator of Ham and Cheese. Language matters a lot. For example, Big "NO!" is commonly played straight in Japanese media, due to the equivalent iya's higher screamability.note It literally means "unpleasant"... but is usually translated "no" when in line with this trope. Sonna can also be used depending on screamability. But not very common in Russian, due to the equivalent nyet's very low screamability. Because Evil Is Hammy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsHammy"], often the Big Bad is the one who screams the Big "NO!", usually as their plans are crashing down around their ears. And also usually the last thing the villain ever says. Often combined with a Futile Hand Reach ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutileHandReach"]. Sometimes followed by a dramatic and very rapid zooming out to the whole block. Or Eat the Camera. Large Hams ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam"] will pull out a Giant "NO!" if given the opportunity. A Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] of Big Word Shout. A Sister Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SisterTrope"] to Slow "NO!" Contrast Big "YES!" ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigYes"]. Compare Little "No", Big "NEVER!", Rapid-Fire "No!", Comical Overreacting, Death Wail, Big "OMG!", Big "WHY?!", Howl of Sorrow, Say My Name, and Atomic F-Bomb. Not to be confused with a certain mecha series with a similar-sounding title ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO"]. See here ["https://tvtropes.orghttp://www.nooo.me/"] for a hilariously useful Instant-Noooo. Here is a compilation ["https://tvtropes.orghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egIIstQR8og"] with a lot of examples of this trope.</hero:tropeDescription>
