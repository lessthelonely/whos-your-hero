    <hero:tropeDescription>The classic Western standard of male beauty,note there was a period in the 18th and 19th centuries when Pretty Boy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy"] was the standard, at least among the elites, but hunks have been more commonly admired at other times the hunk is two things: handsome and manly. His face tends to be squarish and sharp-featured, often with a prominent chin ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanternJawOfJustice"]. He has big, well-muscled arms and a large torso with a slim waist with pronounced muscles. He also has fairly thick, muscular legs, though they get less attention. It is often implied that he is as well-endowed between the legs as in the arms. The hunk may or may not have body hair, depending on the time period, and facial hair is negotiable. Guaranteed, however, to adopt Perma-Stubble during his choice moments as Mr. Fanservice. Clothing tends to be simple and timeless. Nowadays, a hunk's casual wardrobe will consist of tight jeans and either a tank top, tight T-shirt, or flannel shirt (if he wears one at all ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingShirtlessScene"]...works oriented to a female audience have him not in increasing numbers). For work and formal events, a smart suit is a given. The hero of a story, if male, is frequently a hunk, particularly in an action series. If the lead character is a woman, the leading man or the heroine's Love Interest ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest"], if not both, tends to be a hunk. It is rare for a hunk to be an outright villain. However, a nasty hunk is often used to deliver An Aesop ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop"]. In this case, the (usually young, often teenage) heroine will imagine him to be a perfect Knight in Shining Armor type, but he's actually a Prince Charmless, Jerk Jock or vain prick, thus proving that one should not judge another based on appearances. This trope is extremely common in video games, nearing ubiquitous in the sixth generation of video games. As graphical fidelity improved, it was almost inevitable. A grizzled white guy who either fits this trope or is a good shower and haircut away from it is an extremely common design for the main character. As the video game industry's audience has diversified, there have been more diverse protagonists. However, the Hunk isn't going anywhere — even when he's not the protagonist, he'll be around. Being a hunk is a common fantasy, but so is having one around as a friend or love interest. Mr. Fanservice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice"] is usually one of these. Contrast Pretty Boy. East Asian pop-culture tends to use Bishōnen as the go-to "hot guy standard" instead, although the two tropes can cross over for pretty characters that happen to be manly or muscular (such as with Vega from Street Fighter). For its Distaff Counterpart see Amazonian Beauty. For the long-haired version, see Barbarian Longhair.
