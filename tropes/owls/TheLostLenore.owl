    <hero:tropeDescription>    The Lost Lenore is another character's deceased love interest. This kind of tragedy is one of The Oldest Ones in the Book ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestOnesInTheBook"] and named for the famous deceased in Edgar Allan Poe's poems "The Raven" and "Lenore". In short, the three defining criteria are: In determining whether a character who dies during a story can be classified as a Lost Lenore, the third criterion above is the most important: in order to fit this trope, the character must have just as much, if not more, importance to the narrative dead than they would alive. For example, Anna in Van Helsing ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing"] is the hero's love interest and dies at the climax of the story, but she is not a Lost Lenore as all that happens after she dies is that Van Helsing ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing"] is cured, lays her to rest, sees her happy with her family in the afterlife and roll credits. She does more for the story alive than she does dead. Characters who lose Lenore can go on to have other love interests, particularly if she is a Posthumous Character ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter"] or the story is part of an ongoing series. However, in order to qualify for this trope, it must be clear that they grieved strongly for her, and that overcoming their grief and learning to love again is a significant part of character/plot development. Sometimes subsequent love interests never entirely replace Lenore. It can go all the way to a Love Triangle. The Lost Lenore's mode of death can vary but popular choices include: Lenores can also become lost through suicide ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide"], Innocent Bystander Syndrome, a tragic accident, or a Random Act of God. If she left children behind, the children often have considerable emotional baggage to deal with, including a father (or father-figure equivalent) whose grief can render him overprotective, neglectful, abusive ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents"], or absent. The children may feel, or even be told explicitly, that they are either too much like the Lost Lenore, or else not enough like her. Angst ensues. If the Lost Lenore was murdered, a Roaring Rampage of Revenge ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge"] usually ensues. Which leads to a crucial identifying point: many Gwen Stacys are also Lost Lenores, but not every Lost Lenore is also a Gwen Stacy, as someone explicitly blaming themself for the Gwen Stacy's death is an identifying criterion for this trope, whereas this is not always the case for a Lost Lenore. After her death, whether it occurs before the story begins or during its course, the Lost Lenore is present in the thoughts, dialogue, and actions of living characters. Her memory may motivate the living characters to follow the example she set in life ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChainBeyondTheGrave"], or she can be a dynamic presence within a story through the use of Flashback and/or direct interaction with living characters in the form of a Spirit Advisor. Conversely, forces of evil may evoke the memory of the Lost Lenore, or even masquerade as a manifestation of her, in order to manipulate living characters. Sometimes living characters encounter another living character who for whatever reason strongly reminds them of the Lost Lenore. This new character could be a relative, reincarnation, or even just an uncanny doppelganger. In this instance, a romantic relationship may develop, but this is always based primarily on the character's resemblance to the Lost Lenore and, yes, Angst ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst"] can ensue. In some cases, the character may name a weapon or belonging after the Lost Lenore just to remember her and even develop a bond with them. Occasionally, due usually to a dramatic twist ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding"] Lenore turns out not to be dead after all, or dead for reasons by means other than previously believed. The Lost Lenore can sometimes be brought back to life through an act of Time Travel or by magic but her death must be treated as a real event within the story. However, even if the audience knows or characters subsequently discover a twist in the tale, she must still satisfy the major criteria of having been loved and her perceived loss being of ongoing significance in order to qualify for this trope. Not to be confused with the comic book character Lenore the Cute Little Dead Girl ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LenoreTheCuteLittleDeadGirl"] who tends to cause death to other people rather than experiencing it herself. Related tropes include: Cynicism Catalyst ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CynicismCatalyst"], Death by Origin Story, I Let Gwen Stacy Die, Death by Childbirth, Collateral Angst, Crusading Widow, Too Good for This Sinful Earth, The Mourning After, Victorian Novel Disease. Contrast with: Disposable Woman ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableWoman"], Forgotten Fallen Friend, Oh, and X Dies. The One That Got Away isn't dead, but still a lost love.</hero:tropeDescription>
