    <hero:tropeDescription>    So you're a travelin' in time ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel"], as you do, when suddenly! Ooh, it's future you! Only... you're different. And not in a good way. If you were cool, maybe The Hero (or the Alpha Bitch/Jerk Jock), then you discover you've become really lame. Conversely, if you're the Plucky Comic Relief or someone similar, older you is a badass... a scary badass. Or worse, your future self could be evil. Milder versions simply result in a personality change that bugs you. Alternatively, you're the same as ever, and boy, can meeting yourself make you see why others are annoyed by you ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes"]. Maybe it's not you that bugs you so much as your change in social standing. This may lead to you arguing with yourself. Moral of the story? If you're a time traveller, never meet up with yourself ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTheSelvesShallMeet"]. (And were you always that fat?) Commonly used in concert with Bad Future ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture"] and Ominous Message from the Future. See also Mirror Universe, Evil Me Scares Me, Future Badass, Future Loser, Future Self Reveal. Compare Amnesiac Dissonance, Other Me Annoys Me, I Hate Past Me (where your own past shocks you).</hero:tropeDescription>
