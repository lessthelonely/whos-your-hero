    <hero:tropeDescription>He treats almost everyone around him, even other members of the upper class, with a thin veneer of polite disdain, coming off as cold ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen"], arrogant, and uncaring. He values rationality, logic, and abstract ideas and concepts, and cares little for people and emotions. Kindness and empathy is beneath him. At least on the outside. While some Proud Elites are truly that cold, hard-hearted, and arrogant, with no redeeming features, most Proud Elites have a carefully hidden ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheMask"] warmer, kinder side. Their gentler, nicer side will generally only come out around certain people (perhaps around a beautiful princess) or in situations where they can pretend a disinterested or self-serving rationale for their kind actions. Occasionally, a Proud Elite is not deliberately maintaining his cold, arrogant outer persona; he unintentionally comes off that way, generally due to shyness or some other form of social awkwardness. This character type, when set up as a romantic interest, generally appeals to the All Girls Want Bad Boys ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys"] idea, in that the Proud Elite appears "bad" in his aloof arrogance, but generally has a warm heart underneath which allows him to fall in love. Frequently used in Japanese works, although by no means exclusive to them. Japanese examples will frequently be Bish≈çnen ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen"]. If the character's peers are similarly elegant and cultured, they may well be The Beautiful Elite. Often overlaps with Tall, Dark, and Handsome ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallDarkAndHandsome"], Byronic Hero, Jerk with a Heart of Gold, Magnificent Bastard, Insufferable Genius, Princely Young Man, Gentleman Snarker, and Tall, Dark, and Snarky.
