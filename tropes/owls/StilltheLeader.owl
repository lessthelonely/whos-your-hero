    <hero:tropeDescription>The Chains of Commanding ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommanding"] are a heavy burden even for the strongest leader, and lately the new guy has been picking up more and more slack — so much so that he's practically The Leader of the group. He may not always be right or charismatic, but after going on many adventures with The Team, he's become so influential that he's the leader in all but name. This can happen slowly or suddenly. Often, the group is thrust into situations they simply can't handle, but the new guy consistently rises to the occasion. The old leader may contribute by over-relying on the new guy or even formally give up his leadership ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch"]. However, he may cling to his position and insist he's still in charge — in this case, the changeover usually happens because the rest of the group has voiced support for the new guy. In effect, the old boss was quickly demoted ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuicklyDemotedLeader"] into a Leader Wannabe. If the old boss goes mad with jealousy, he might try to retake his position by force. This rarely works. If he stepped aside, he might become The Mentor.</hero:tropeDescription>
