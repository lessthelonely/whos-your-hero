    <hero:tropeDescription>   Everyone loves ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool"] flashy magic, BFGs, and big, thundering tanks. However, the more interesting something is, the more likely it falls victim to the rule of Awesome, but Impractical: You can't use it often enough, it costs too much, or it just takes too much effort to get it. You could even have Cool, but Inefficient, where it just looks awesome, but that is about it. Therefore, we have things that are much more "boring" and normal, but these things often contribute more to your success in the long term than the visually more impressive things. The Reliable Ones ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReliableOne"], if you will â€” and proof that Hollywood does not always hate boring. Often overlaps with Mundane Solution. As the list below shows, this trope doesn't require that a non-boring counterpart exists. Things that will frequently fall into this trope: Fits into the Technician side of Technician Versus Performer ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicianVersusPerformer"], by nature. May border on Game-Breaker, or an outright High-Tier Scrappy as a result of the most optimal play being terribly uninteresting. Compare Simple, yet Awesome. Contrast Awesome, but Impractical; Cool, but Inefficient. If mass-produced, it's likely to become The Workhorse. Sometimes overlaps with Vanilla Unit.</hero:tropeDescription>
