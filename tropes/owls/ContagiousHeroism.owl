    <hero:tropeDescription>When an anti-heroic ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero"] or outright villainous character is forced by circumstances to work with a heroic character and over time, becomes more selfless and cooperative as a result (though not necessarily to Heel–Face Turn levels). They may even blame The Hero for making them go "soft" — often right after a Conscience Makes You Go Back or a Changed My Mind, Kid moment. This is even more likely to occur if the heroic character is a Messianic Archetype, an All-Loving Hero, etc. A type of Character Development ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment"]. Toxic Friend Influence and Peer Pressure Makes You Evil are the opposites. Compare Paying It Forward, Got Me Doing It (which is about mannerisms rather than internal values), Good Feels Good (which is about good's inherent superiority over evil, rather than personal influence), and The Paragon (who actively strives to make this happen). Compare/contrast Morality Pet, who induces niceness in a villain who otherwise remains perfectly vile.</hero:tropeDescription>
