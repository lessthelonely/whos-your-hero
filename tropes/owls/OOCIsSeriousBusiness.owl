    <hero:tropeDescription>Some characters have strong traits that they are known by ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharactersAsDevice"]. This is for when characters momentarily break away from their normal habits to make a point about the seriousness of the situation. Often causes the other characters to do a Double Take and mention why this event is Serious Business. When most or all of these OoC moments happen at once, you can be sure that the Darkest Hour has arrived, leading characters to behave in ways they normally wouldn't, because they know they might not have another chance to do so. It's also a pretty good indication the Godzilla Threshold ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold"] has been crossed. This is a trope for when a somewhat-Out-of-Character ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter"] action is used to draw extra attention to the scene (similar to a Title Drop). It isn't Hidden Depths because it isn't telling us something about the character we didn't already know; it's similar to an Out-of-Character ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter"] Moment in that this is specifically the usage of such a moment to draw attention to a scene. If they're doing this deliberately to make another character think something is amiss, see Out-of-Character ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter"] Alert. Compare Let's Get Dangerous! and Weirder Than Usual. A Super-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTrope"] of:</hero:tropeDescription>
