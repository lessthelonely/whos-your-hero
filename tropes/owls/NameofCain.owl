    <hero:tropeDescription>Ever since that guy in The Bible ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible"] killed his brother, characters named Cain, Caine, Kane, Kayne, or variants, have had a bad reputation. They tend to be villains. Since Evil Is Cool, though, it was only a matter of time before the name became acceptable fodder for the odd antihero, as well. Either way, they tend to be morally sketchy, and probably badass. For when the character is actually Cain ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cain"] himself, see Cain ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cain"] and Biblical Bad Guy. For when the character is descended from him, see The Descendants of Cain ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cain"]. A specific form of Names to Run Away from Really Fast ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast"], and, of course, a Meaningful Name. Also see Cain and Cain and Abel, for obvious reasons. Compare One-Mario Limit.</hero:tropeDescription>
