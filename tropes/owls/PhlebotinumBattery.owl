    <hero:tropeDescription>This is when a character's powers are charged by some outside source, such as sunlight ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfTheSun"], moonlight, electricity or exposure to Phlebotinium. If the hero's powers are ever taken away or are weakened somehow, all the hero needs to do to get them back is regain access to this source of power and they are rejuvenated. The exact opposite of Kryptonite Factor ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor"]. A Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] of Power Source, and Super-Trope to Background Magic Field. Compare Energy Absorption (which can occur for reasons other than replenishing energy), Amulet of Concentrated Awesome, and Phlebotinum Muncher for when they feed on the phlebotinum itself. If the phlebotinum is commonplace and must be ingested, it's Power-Up Food.</hero:tropeDescription>
