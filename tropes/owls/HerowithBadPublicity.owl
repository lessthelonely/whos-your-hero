    <hero:tropeDescription>Being a Superhero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero"] isn't all it's cracked up to be. The heroes' lives and those of their loved ones are constantly in danger from their archnemeses â€” and sometimes from their own powers, too. Sometimes someone else takes credit for their heroic efforts. But perhaps the most hurtful and confusing drawback comes when the people they've sworn to protect hate their guts.

A character who can do no wrong in the public eye has 100% Heroism Rating. When the hero is pushed too far and concludes that being a hero for this undeserving society is up to no good, he might as well become evil... Contrast Karmic Shunning, in which a character is deserving of their pariah status. As it is highly subjective to call someone a hero in real life, No Real Life Examples, Please!
