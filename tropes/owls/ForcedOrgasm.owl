    <hero:tropeDescription>Simply put: when somebody is brought to orgasm against their will ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin"], whether it be a modest or immodest one. It may be done either deliberately by molestation/sexual assault, psychic powers or sometimes even accidentally. The accidental type may involve some device stimulating the victimnoteÂ a vibrating cellphone for instance with no means to remove/escape it. In extreme cases even a clueless person may be the cause of this ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidntMeanToTurnYouOn"] especially if the recipient has some weird and unusual sensitive spots. While this trope may overlap with Jizzed in My Pants ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JizzedInMyPants"], JIMP doesn't require much effort or even direct physical stimulation. The focus there is on how little stimulation was required for the orgasm. Forced Orgasm, on the other hand, can happen regardless of arousal. The amount of required effort is usually related to how perverse or despicable the perpetrator is, how unfortunate/helpless the victim is, or even both.  This trope may involve Electric Instant Gratification ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectricInstantGratification"] or Orgasmatron if done by a Mad Scientist. The characters causing this may invoke I Didn't Mean to Turn You On, "Not If They Enjoyed It" Rationalization or Cool and Unusual Punishment, especially if the situation is Played for Laughs. As per the Content Policy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/ContentPolicy"], note that we don't want any real-life examples of tropes like this one.</hero:tropeDescription>
