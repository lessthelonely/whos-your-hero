    <hero:tropeDescription>A Person of Mass Destruction is a character with powers, abilities, or skills capable of causing damage on the level of a Weapon of Mass Destruction ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction"]. As a Speculative Fiction trope, it is frequently used as a metaphor for real-world technology â€” often nuclear weapons. The source of their destructive powers varies; they may have won the Superpower Lottery, have knowledge of Things Man Was Not Meant to Know or be a Physical God. What gives them their destructive potential is less important than the fact that they have it. The reaction to a PoMD is often fear, anger, and hate ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer"], which may cross over into outright abuse. Despite this, their chances of being either a Hero or a Villain are about the same, and depend on whether they believe With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility or Might Makes Right. A person of mass destruction is more likely than normal to undergo Superpower Meltdown at some point, channeling the fear of losing control of a conventional weapon of mass destruction, as with an Empty Quiver situation. They will almost always score at least as a Class 4 on the Super Weight ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperWeight"] scale or higher. Compare with Human Weapon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanWeapon"], for when someone is literally treated as a weapon. See also Destructive Saviour and Walking Disaster Area. A person like this is almost always a One-Man Army, which is usually a downplayed version of this trope.</hero:tropeDescription>
