    <hero:tropeDescription>No, Not That Kind of Partner ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotThatKindOfPartner"]. This is when two characters have been friends ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestFriend"] for a long time, and share a closeness like that of a married couple. Occasionally, there are individuals who assume the duo are married or dating, or try to set them up as a couple. However, the duo is perfectly happy just being friends ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestFriend"] and the lack of sexual attraction is mutual. The reasons behind this vary. Sometimes they're truly in love with someone else. Sometimes their sexual orientation makes them incompatible. Sometimes they even tried dating once a long time ago and realized that they just didn't think of each other like that. Whatever the case, the final result is entirely platonic on both sides. In most cases, this is a Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] of Like Brother and Sister. The difference is that for Platonic Life Partners, their relationship with each other is the most important relationship, with even romantic relationships coming in second (sometimes it's on the same level). The same-sex equivalent is Heterosexual Life-Partners. Simply being friends doesn't make a pair an example, nor does just being True Companions ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions"]—rather, in terms of The Four Loves, this is Philia with overtones of Storge but a complete lack of Eros. Despite their tendency to inspire shipping, there's a good reason they're called Platonic Life Partners. However, there is precedent for Relationship Upgrades to occasionally happen if one or both partners realize their feelings run deeper. Occasionally, Better as Friends and Anchored Ship also will crossover into this trope if a romantic pairing changes their status, voluntarily or otherwise. Before you add an example to this page, make sure it really fits the trope. Harry Potter and Hermione Granger ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter"] are a good example of two characters who don't belong here. Although they are close friends, they are both closer to Ron than they are to each other.note It is made especially clear during a fight in Goblet of Fire that Ron is Harry's best friend over Hermione, while Hermione is presumably closer to Ron than Harry, at least by the end of the series. They're Like Brother and Sister. This is common in shows targeted at young children, even if the characters themselves are significantly older than the viewing audience, based on the assumption that little kids don't want to watch a bunch of "mushy stuff." ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionHatingKid"] Often also invoked by fans of science fiction series who similarly don't want the stories watered down with romance. Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] of The Not-Love Interest. Compare Better as Friends. Contrast Just Friends for when this does actually blossom into romance. Not to be confused with Childhood Friend Romance, which is a relationship dynamic that may look like this trope in childhood but which manifests romantic feelings in adulthood.</hero:tropeDescription>
