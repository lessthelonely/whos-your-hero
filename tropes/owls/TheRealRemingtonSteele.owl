    <hero:tropeDescription>A new character appears on the scene, usually with a noticeable air of mystery surrounding him or her. Eventually, the mask (literal or metaphorical) is removed, and the stranger turns out to be a disguise created by an established character for some purpose. But — by this point, the creator(s) have had to devote a significant amount of creative effort detailing the false guise; it has a name and an image, and from a legal standpoint represents a potential trademark. It'd be a waste to just throw it away. So, naturally, another heretofore unknown character pops up to become the "real" bearer of that identity. Sometimes this is simply an opportunist taking up the unused mantle; sometimes, it involves a retcon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon"] establishing the guise as a preexisting character. Named ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers"] for the TV series Remington Steele, whose premise had P.I. Laura Holt concoct a fictitious male employer to head her detective agency and thus appease chauvinist expectations of potential customers — only for an anonymous rogue to hijack the identity (and thus the agency) himself. See also Impersonation-Exclusive Character ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpersonationExclusiveCharacter"], Invented Individual, Masquerading As the Unseen, and Fake–Real Turn. Result of the same motivation as the Legacy Character. Compare Charlie Brown from Outta Town and Accidentally Real Fake Address. Contrast with Dead Person Impersonation.</hero:tropeDescription>
