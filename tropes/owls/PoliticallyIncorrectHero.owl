    <hero:tropeDescription>Usually, in modern stories, a character who's a sexist, racist, or something else of that kind ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain"] is the bad guy. This is mostly due to the present-day realization that prejudice is bad. Sometimes, either due to a Writer on Board ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard"], Values Dissonance, Deliberate Values Dissonance, or something else, a character can get away with opinions that are... controversial. If the excuse is well-done, it can work. If not, it seems like a Karma Houdini. Unless, of course, they are punished for it, or forced to undergo a Faceâ€“Heel Turn. It has become increasingly common for heroes of this type to not only have their political incorrectness lampshaded ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging"] by the author and by other characters, but to be aware of it themselves. This type of "hero" knows his attitudes are wrong but is too proud to give them up, usually due to Honor Before Reason. Or perhaps they are unashamed of their opinions, but compared to the villain they're still the clear hero. He might develop into a Noble Bigot or Troubled Sympathetic Bigot. In Shock Rock ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockRock"] and more shock-driven Hip-Hop genres like Gangsta Rap and Horrorcore, political incorrectness is often done to make an artistic point. Sometimes it can be the catharsis of the performer getting to represent negative stereotypes about their gender, race, sexuality, etc.; sometimes it's to create an atmosphere where the listener can be thrilled by having their feelings hurt in a safe context; sometimes it's to make a point about freedom of speech and the dangerous effect of Moral Guardians; and sometimes it's just to make the listener's parents feel uncomfortable. Also see Good Flaws, Bad Flaws ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFlawsBadFlaws"] for a more thorough analysis of "discrimination as a flaw".
