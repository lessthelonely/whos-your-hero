    <hero:tropeDescription>Pirates ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pirate"] are cool; so are ninjas. So pirates fighting ninjas must be awesome. And why not make them all fight some robots while we're at it? Oh and don't forget the zombies. Related to the Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot"] and Bread, Eggs, Breaded Eggs, this trope is a case when two types of cool things battle it out. Unlike an Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny, this is not a case when two specific characters Duel to the Death. Though a battle can qualify as both, if the two characters are two different character types. Bonus points if the two don't exist in the same time-period, place, or universe ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse"]. A Massive Multiplayer Crossover ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveMultiplayerCrossover"] often invokes this. A Versus Title is a sure sign of the trope at work and such a work is a good draw for those who are Just Here for Godzilla. A Super-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTrope"] to Fur Against Fang, Pirates vs. Ninjas, Fight Dracula (because a character needs to be awesome themselves to fight him). It's not directly related to Elves Versus Dwarves, though; as that trope is not about literal elves and dwarves fighting but about traits of two opposing sides. Can overlap with Behemoth Battle if both fighters are giant-sized. Frequently the subject of a Hypothetical Fight Debate.</hero:tropeDescription>
