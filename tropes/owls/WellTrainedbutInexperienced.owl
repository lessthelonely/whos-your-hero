    <hero:tropeDescription>They say that any new skill can be learned with proper observation and a deep, clinical understanding of the subject matter. Or at least, that's the theory. In practice, even the most practical forms of training and education may end up failing the student when they finally have to face the subject in the real world. Consequently, in this trope, characters who've learned their skills through the best training that money can buy may find themselves folding like cheap suits the moment they leave the training grounds — especially in the case of military training. Part of this is due to the fact that, sad to say, the lessons can't account for literally everything a trainee is expected to do in the field. More important is the simple fact that the education almost always takes place in a controlled environment of some kind: no matter how extreme the training, most teachers actually want their students to survive long enough to apply their skills outside of classrooms or boot camp, so the lessons won't actually feature all the potential threats that they would face in the real world, only comparatively safe approximations. Once the trainees are forced to use the training they've learned when up against real, tangible danger, they will likely find themselves under incredible stress and start making mistakes. All of this can lead to a form of Performance Anxiety ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerformanceAnxiety"], the realization of just how out of their depth they really are leaving the character paralyzed with fear and left at their opponent's mercy. If they push through it and try to get a hit in, chances are that they'll still be completely overwhelmed by any of the many, many factors that their training did not account for, and in the process, get thoroughly curb-stomped. The counterpoint to this is Taught by Experience ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience"], where someone has the skills to handle the project but never went through the comprehensive training to expand their knowledge base past the immediate needs of the work. If these two people interact you might find a Technician Versus Performer situation. Depending on the story, this will end in either a horribly ignominious death, or a valuable source of experience that will end in the character becoming genuinely Strong and Skilled ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAndSkilled"]. Compare Ensign Newbie ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsignNewbie"], Every Year They Fizzle Out, Paper Tiger and Weak, but Skilled. Contrast Incompletely Trained, Strong and Skilled and Unskilled, but Strong. See also Skilled, but Naive, where the Naďve Newcomer can come across as rather ditzy or green-horned, but are still able to do what they do best when given the opportunity. May result in a (subverted) case of When All You Have Is a Hammer…</hero:tropeDescription>
