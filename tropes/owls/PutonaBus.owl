    <hero:tropeDescription>So you're a film or TV show producer or the author of a book series, or the team behind a comic book, and you have a problem. You want a character out of the story, but you don't want to kill them off, you're not going to just flat out ignore them ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus"], and you certainly wouldn't have them just disappear for no reason and with no mention of it. However, there is a situation in which a character can be written out of a series in such a way that they can easily be returned later, if the creators so choose. They are Put on a Bus. A staple of the Prime Time Soap ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimeTimeSoap"] and particularly Soap Opera where casts are large and actor turnover is frequent. Conveniently, when such a character is brought back and now played by a different actor, it can be a case of Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome or The Other Darrin. Often a case of Real Life Writes the Plot, due to actors leaving a franchise for various reasons. If the actor is only leaving temporarily, with the expectation that they'll return (due to appearing in a movie, going on maternity leave, etc.) and their character is written back into the show once they do, it's The Bus Came Back ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack"]. If the character doesn't leave in such a way that arranging a return would be simple, this becomes a Long Bus Trip. Should they start appearing infrequently, they're Commuting on a Bus or Out of Focus. If there's obvious malice involved in the character's departure, then they've been Put on a Bus to Hell. If the character is arrested, then they've been Put on a Prison Bus. There's also the chance of a Bus Crash or dying on the bus. The bus in question may be a Convenient Coma ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientComa"]. Opposite of Dropped a Bridge on Him ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim"]. Compare with Sequel Non-Entity (a character disappearing from the show with little-to-no explanation), Chuck Cunningham Syndrome (a character disappearing from the franchise with little-to-no explanation), What Happened to the Mouse? (where the story continues with a minor character's final fate left unknown), and Written-In Absence, for when a character disappears for only an episode or two.</hero:tropeDescription>
