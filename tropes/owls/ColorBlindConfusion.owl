    <hero:tropeDescription>In Real Life ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife"], partial ("red-green" or "blue-yellow") and full colorblindness are among the most common disabilities, affecting around 8% of males and 0.5% of females worldwide, with the number possibly being even higher as many people go through life unaware that they have the condition due to it not causing problems in their lives. In fiction, however, a character having this is usually a Chekhov's Gun ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun"] or is only brought up in a situation where being able to distinguish colors is vitally important, such as a Wire Dilemma or needing to identify a key object by color alone. The fact that colorblindness is usually inherited means it can also be used to prove or disprove a character's parentage if they have it while another character does or does not, though much like the AB Negative trope the mechanism of inheritance is often over-simplified, especially with females who are far more likely to be an asymptomatic carrier for the condition unless they get it from both sides, due to the most common gene associated with the condition being carried on the X Chromosome. It's also sometimes used as an explanation for a character's horrendous fashion sense, in which case it's often Played for Laughs. Since colorblindness can disqualify a person from receiving certain types of licenses, especially aircraft, a character learning they have this is sometimes used as a Dream-Crushing Handicap. May also occur with Funny Animal ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal"] or Uplifted Animal characters pointing out that their species is naturally colorblind as a Furry Reminder. When this trope is applied to dogs it's a case of Science Marches On, as it's now known that while dogs may not see colors as well as humans (they can't see red or green, for instance) they're still able to distinguish them. Compare Blind Mistake ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindMistake"], where a character being unable to see at all causes confusion, and Animals See in Monochrome (which often uses this trope). Not to be confused with Colorblind Casting, where an actor's race is not taken into account when casting a role.</hero:tropeDescription>
