    <hero:tropeDescription>A villain who adheres to the philosophy that The Needs of the Many ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany"] outweigh the needs of the few. At best, they're a Well-Intentioned Extremist ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist"] who believes that Utopia Justifies the Means and they did what they had to. They might eventually have a Heel Realization or die in their struggle for the greater good... or maybe they're actually right. At worst, they're a Knight Templar hellbent on assimilating everyone in a Lotus-Eater Machine, killing everyone who is unhappy, killing everyone to stop unhappiness, or doing things that would send them plunging toward the Moral Event Horizon... if not worse. What makes the Totalitarian Utilitarian a frightening character is that while their For Happiness ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForHappiness"] motive is tragically flawed, they are ruthlessly efficient to those ends and have no hobbies, no pastimes, and no friends — nothing that could be used against them, in other words. A Totalitarian Utilitarian character is often a Strawman Political ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter"], but is just as likely to simply be a regular villain whom the authors tried to make a bit less senseless by adding a grain of Strawman Has a Point. If Romanticism Versus Enlightenment is a theme, he will almost always side with the Enlightenment. Compare Happiness Is Mandatory. Contrast Principles Zealot. Compare and contrast Dark Messiah. See also Tragic Dream. No historical examples ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/NoRealLifeExamplesPlease"] at all, m'kay? (However, feel free to go around this with examples of how various authors have portrayed various groups.)
