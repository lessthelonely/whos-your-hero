    <hero:tropeDescription>A relevant reference to an event taking place earlier than the timeline of the present story. One type of call back is a Running Gag ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag"]. This is often used to remind viewers that there is an ongoing storyline. More or less a Shout-Out to itself â€” but if that's all that it's doing, then it's a Continuity Nod; a Call-Back brings back an element that is actually relevant again. Compare: Alternately, in comedy: Tying the loose ends of a later, seemingly unrelated, joke to one earlier in the show; better known as a Brick Joke ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke"]. Sometimes a Call-Back will take up so much of a chapter or episode that it becomes a Sequel Episode ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEpisode"] to the earlier story it's referencing. The opposite of this is either Foreshadowing ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing"] (a forward reference done in a previous episode) or Call-Forward (a "fake" forward reference in a flashback or prequel). If a creator is referencing their previous work in a way that's separate from the plot, that's Production Throwback.
