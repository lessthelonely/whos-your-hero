    <hero:tropeDescription>Nicknames and other forms of names hung upon a person by others can be a strange thing. They can be random names, or they can be shortened forms of full names, or they can suggest something about the person, like the Hulk. And then there's the case where the nickname deliberately does not ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony"] describe the person. The most famous one is probably the name "Tiny". Any guy called "Tiny" will invariably be either morbidly obese or eight feet tall with more muscles than a Mr. Universe contest. The same is true for "Shorty" or "Pipsqueak" or any variation on a name or nickname implying "very small." Very popular in Australia, where a bald man will be called "Curly" and a redhead "Bluey." Also popular in the Chicano (Mexican-American) culture, where a rotund man will be called "El Flaco" ("The Skinny Man"), a light-skinned woman will be called "La Negra" ("The Black Woman") and so on. A Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] of Non-Indicative Name. See Ironic Name for when the given name, not the nickname, is ironic. For something similar applied to pets and animals, see Fluffy the Terrible and Deathbringer the Adorable.</hero:tropeDescription>
