    <hero:tropeDescription>Due to the Buxom Beauty Standard ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomBeautyStandard"], some women are concerned with their cup sizes, so they try to increase them with padding or surgery. Usually used as a way to demonstrate A-Cup Angst, and as a method for Breast Expansion. Very commonly Played for Laughs. For someone who's a Cross Dresser ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossDresser"] or Disguised in Drag, simply using two appropriately-sized balls or stuffing a bra will suffice, but store-bought fake breasts are also available. Sometimes when two girls disguise themselves as a tall woman in a trench coat ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotemPoleTrench"], the folded-up legs of the top girl will be the bust. See also Pillow Pregnancy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PillowPregnancy"]. Compare Compensating for Something and Fake Muscles and contrast Hidden Buxom. Often involved in a Boob-Based Gag.</hero:tropeDescription>
