    <hero:tropeDescription>Two male characters portray different aspects of masculinity. The Noble Male is generally world-wise, gentlemanly, and sophisticated ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanAndAScholar"]—while the Roguish Male is generally street-wise, grizzled, and uncouth. The former will generally focus on a single special lady and treat her with the highest respect while the latter tends more toward sleeping around with many women or is just not interested in sex and romance at all. If he is, romance with him is likely to be destructive, deadly even, if he is any good with women at all. Basically, the Noble Man is what the single woman is looking for and the Roguish Man what all the girls out there lust after. Differs from Sensitive Guy and Manly Man ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensitiveGuyAndManlyMan"] in that the Noble Male is still very much considered "manly" — but is so in a more chivalrous fashion, rather than in an aggressive fashion. A love triangle between them might be The Gentleman or the Scoundrel ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGentlemanOrTheScoundrel"] or a male version of Betty and Veronica. Also related is Red Oni, Blue Oni, with the Noble Male being the Blue to the Roguish Male's Red. Contrast the polar opposites, Bifauxnen and Lad-ette ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BifauxnenAndLadette"] — two girls who are both masculine, but in different ways — and Light Feminine and Dark Feminine — two girls who are both feminine, but in different ways. As with any two-character trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuoTropes"], the two characters have to have some sort of relationship with each other, be it friends, family, love interests, or rivals for a love interest, so the two characters can be playing the traits directly off each other. If they become enemies at some point, then it's Chevalier vs. Rogue. If they're in a military-like organization, they're often Captain Smooth and Sergeant Rough. In modern Western culture, "feminine" usually implies Light Feminine, while "masculine" usually implies Roguish Male ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemaleAngelMaleDemon"]. When Dark Feminine and Noble Male are paired up, you usually get Masculine Girl, Feminine Boy.</hero:tropeDescription>
