    <hero:tropeDescription> It isn't at all unusual for siblings to be close to each other. Lots of siblings will hang out with each other and show some sibling affection towards each other. If someone else sees them and knows that they're related, they won't raise any eyebrows. If they do not know that they're related, they might think the two are dating ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForRomance"]. Oftentimes, the one who catches the two together is a lover or love interest of one of the siblings, and thus thinks that they are cheating ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForCheating"] or doesn't like them. Drama and/or Hilarity Ensues. This trope is often used as a type of The Reveal ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal"] where the audience does not know that the two siblings are related beforehand, and are led to believe that the person is cheating or likes someone else. And, of course, this is most definitely Truth in Television ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"]. This is somewhat the inverse of, but definitely comparable to, Like Brother and Sister ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister"] â€” in which they have a close, platonic, but non-genetic relationship. If the characters themselves don't know, it's Surprise Incest. If their resemblance to a romantic couple is particularly convincing, there may be Incest Subtext at work; if it's more convincing than the idea that they're brother and sister even to the audience who's already in on the secret, that's probably Platonic Writing, Romantic Reading. Sometimes though, it happens to be Exactly What It Looks Like. This can happen with cousins ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins"], as well. With parents, it may overlap with Absurdly Youthful Mother: if a character's parent doesn't look old enough to be their parent, mistaking them for a romantic partner is all the more likely. Compare Mistaken for Related. If the two siblings are the same gender, then this also crosses over with Mistaken for Gay. Also an inversion ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope"] of Relatively Flimsy Excuse, when a character lies about another character being related to them in order to provide a cover story.</hero:tropeDescription>
