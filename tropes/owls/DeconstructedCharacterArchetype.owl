    <hero:tropeDescription>Deconstructing a trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope"] involves taking an existing trope, playing it straight, and examining the likely/realistic consequences or implications of that trope that tend to be ignored by straight examples of it. This trope does the same thing, but for fictional character archetypes. One way to do this is to take a familiar character type and place the character in a realistic setting, and then explore what happens as a result of the character being Wrong Genre Savvy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy"]. Another is to explore likely facets of the character's personality or background that straight examples of the trope tend to overlook. This can also be done as part of a Genre Deconstruction if certain character archetypes are closely associated with a particular genre (what would Westerns be without the archetypical Cowboy?). A particularly interesting (and decidedly meta) way to do this is by taking an actor known only for playing certain kinds of roles and casting them in a role which deconstructs that character type. Note, however, that an actor deconstructing their established persona or character type is not automatically an example of this trope unless their persona is a recognizable character archetype in its own right. As a rule of thumb, examples of this trope should be deconstructions of character archetypes that already have their trope pages (The Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero"], The Lancer, Anti-Villain, etc.), unless the character archetype is no longer in current use (Discredited Trope, Forgotten Trope, etc.). A subtrope of both Deconstruction ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction"] and Deconstructed Trope (insofar as character archetypes are tropes in their own right).
