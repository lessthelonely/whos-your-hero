    <hero:tropeDescription>Nobody who wears glasses in TV ever needs them for minor vision correction, except for reading glasses that are worn mainly to make the character look wise ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurelyAestheticGlasses"]. Almost all TV characters with glasses have such bad vision that if they are deprived of their spectacles, they are practically blind â€” usually hammered home by showing (briefly) the character's uselessly blurry point of view or the character making a Blind Mistake. In western animation, when such a character's glasses are lost, their eyes usually shrink down to pinpoints, which indicates either that they are squinting to see, or to point out the jarring real life effect of seeing someone who has huge eyes when seen through heavily magnified glasses without their glasses. An anime variation on this is usually represented with the character's eyes being replaced by 3's or 3_3 ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Emoticon"], which is another stylization of squinting. Oddly, when a character discards his/her glasses in order to look more attractive ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlassesGottaGo"] or more badass, that character invariably turns out not to be blind without 'em after all (unless it's a parody). Sometimes both will occur, with the character's eyesight varying based on what's convenient for the situation. This is a Super-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTrope"] to Blind Mistake and Dropped Glasses. Note: Because special lenses are needed to keep eyeglasses from flashing stage lights or reflecting filming equipment, any time an actor wears glasses onscreen, it's a deliberate character choice, and the glasses will have anti-reflective coating. If an actor needs corrective lenses and it's deemed wrong for the character, they'll either wear contacts or go without and pretend they're not as blind as a bat. Truth in Television ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"], but with wildly varied degrees of hilarity, if any. See also Glasses Curiosity ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassesCuriosity"], Nerd Glasses, and Universal Eyeglasses. Unrelated to the various tropes on the Index Myopia ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndexMyopia"], which are about figurative forms of myopia.
