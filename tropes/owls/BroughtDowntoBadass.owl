    <hero:tropeDescription>    The world of superheroes has all types. Some gain their powers through Training from Hell ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell"] and gain Charles Atlas Superpowers, while others get them from some form of Applied Phlebotinum. Trouble is, most heroes with the latter form have an Achilles' Heel of some kind; it could be a Weaksauce Weakness, some Kryptonite Factor, or a Power Nullifier, that can rob them of their powers. When this happens, these heroes are left utterly useless, as their entire hero status rested on those powers. But sometimes, we will run across a hero who can still dish it out when their powers are gone. Basically, they have been Brought Down to Normal, but they aren't useless or helpless. These heroes (or villains) may be Crazy-Prepared ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared"] and trained in non-powered fighting in case of such an occasion. Or, they may have gotten their powers after learning five forms of martial arts. Or, maybe they just plain didn't use their powers to kick ass anyway, or just used their powers to enhance their already formidable fighting skills. Or, they're just that badass that they don't need powers to kick you into next week. To qualify, a character must have had powers at one point, must lose them, and must still kick butt without them. If the character's powers have been changed or reduced, but they still have powers, it's not this trope (but it might be Fights Like a Normal ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightsLikeANormal"]). Sometimes a character's powers also forced them to act rather conservatively (or handed them an Idiot Ball ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall"]) to balance things out, but once powerless they start fighting in a smarter way - and can stop holding back. This is the opposite of Empowered Badass Normal ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal"], although it can be a result of such a thing being reversed. See Badass Normal for those who never had powers to begin with. Compare with Got the Call on Speed Dial ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GotTheCallOnSpeedDial"] or Power Loss Makes You Strong.</hero:tropeDescription>
