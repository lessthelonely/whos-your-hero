    <hero:tropeDescription>Sometimes a decent person has to do something bad because it is the only way to prevent something worse from happening. 'I Did What I Had To Do' generally involves an after-the-fact justification for morally questionable ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil"] actions. The culprit presents this statement when he's confronted with a "What Were You Thinking?", "Was It Really Worth It?" or "What the Hell, Hero?" reaction from someone (particularly The Heart) to whom he owes an explanation. The questioned character will generally say, "I did what I had to do." And, more often than not, nothing else. The consequences of such an action vary, of course, depending on the work's place in the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVsCynicism"]. A character who sincerely regrets the 'necessary' action is likely to regard it as Dirty Business, suffer Past Experience Nightmares, or try to forget through chemical means. Someone who realizes they don't feel all that bad about the 'necessity' may be suffering from Start of Darkness. A character who was already rather amoral might say this only because they're upset that they had to get their hands dirty. Generally associated with O.O.C. Is Serious Business ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness"]. Compare Well-Intentioned Extremist and It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time. When the character's motivation is her responsibility to those under her command, see The Chains of Commanding. If the consequences shown actually justify the action, then The Extremist Was Right. A character growing too comfortable with 'doing what I had to do' is guilty of a Reverse Slippery Slope Fallacy. Can be a Moral Event Horizon if it was particularly cruel or if they're particularly callous and nonchalant about it when confronted. If invoked large-scale by a Visionary Villain, it's Utopia Justifies the Means. Also, see Just Following Orders.</hero:tropeDescription>
