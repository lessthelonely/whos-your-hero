    <hero:tropeDescription>If you were given the power to travel through time ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel"] and Set Right What Once Went Wrong, how would you improve the world? For many, the answer is obvious: kill Adolf Hitler. This would prevent the atrocities of World War II, The Holocaust, and their myriad side-effects... right? Unfortunately, even in the land of fiction, this is not an easy task. For one, Hitler survived at least 42 real-life assassination attempts ["https://tvtropes.orghttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assassination_attempts_on_Adolf_Hitler"] thanks to his various bodyguards and security forces— maybe one of them was (or will have been) yours! Targeting him before his rise to power will often turn out to be ludicrously difficult as well— locating a lone, disillusioned war veteran wandering around post-WWI Europe is one hell of a needle-in-a-haystack search. Secondly, even if you do manage to kill him, something as bad or worse might appear in his place ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero"]: maybe an even worse dictator takes over and actually wins, or maybe the Soviet Union starts the war instead. Maybe Imperial Japan never gets in a war it can't win and manages to create its own lasting nightmarish superpower. Maybe if there was no horrific slaughter of "undesirables" that took place under Hitler's leadership, the rest of the world wouldn't have experienced the sort of collective shock upon discovery of the Holocaust that spurred them into beginning the process of purging racist and fascist elements from their own lands. Maybe Hitler's death will cause some kind of paradox, from retroactively erasing lives in the present to destroying the universe itself. In short, it appears to be a cosmic law that something bad has to go down in the period of 1933—1945, and Hitler's premature death is either impossible or will make things worse. For narrative purposes, consider the Anthropic Principle ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple"]: who would read a story in which someone tries to change history for the better, succeeds, and creates a stable utopian timeline that isn't infested with Clock Roaches? After they've killed off Hitler, what would the author do with the rest of the book? Interestingly, it seems that neither FDR ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt"] nor Churchill (or even Stalin while allied with them) have this immunity, because stories come up all the time about heroes having to stop a time-travelling neo-Nazi from sabotaging the Allies— villains simply wouldn't care about any of the possible consequences. Compare Joker Immunity ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity"] and Godwin's Law of Time Travel. This is a sub-trope of Precrime Arrest, which is about anyone being punished for something that the time traveler knows they will eventually do. This is one case where attempts to Prevent the War are ultimately counterproductive. See the Analysis page ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/HitlersTimeTravelExemptionAct"] for musings on how this trope might have worked in Real Life had Hitler actually died earlier. </hero:tropeDescription>
