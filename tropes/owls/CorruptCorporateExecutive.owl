    <hero:tropeDescription>A senior manager, CEO or owner of a major definitely-for-profit corporation ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp"] who is out to make as much money and gain as much power as possible, by any means available, regardless of who suffers. To that end, they are perfectly willing to violate business or social ethics, commit crimes (ranging from fraudulent accounting to mass murder), and devastate Mother Nature and human communities, justifying those actions under the name of "just business." They are confident that all they have to do is spread enough money around to get their way or avoid punishment, and are very likely to cross the Moral Event Horizon in their search for profit. They are also very, very likely to be White (or Asian) and male, like CEOs in real life. Expect to find them at the head of an enormous boardroom table on the top floor of an Evil Tower of Ominousness ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTowerOfOminousness"]. He may be a Bad Boss, but not always. A few of them can actually be very decent employers, with employees who are completely in the dark about their underhanded plans. If so, the public is often just as much in the dark. Naturally, this sort of villain tends to have an Amoral Attorney (or several) on his payroll to keep the authorities off his back, in case he does slip up, and a small stormtrooper army of "security personnel" who have carte blanche to "deal with problems", dispose of evidence of wrongdoing and commit violent crimes to protect the boss. If those resources fail, he often uses money to "buy" or even "own" officials. In more Dystopian settings, expect them to be like dictators, each leading a Mega-Corp. They usually fail to consider ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic"] the full effects of their plan, or the fact that they can make more by going legit, and at times the plan seems to have no concrete way of creating wealth. Usually, they remain in business thanks to Offscreen Villain Dark Matter. Expect them to butt heads with fellows executives when their plans give the business a P.R. headache. If they have a Dragon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon"], expect them to be a vice executive or personal assistant. If The Dragon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon"] is female, then she’ll most likely be a Secretary of Evil. They can either be a Beleaguered Assistant or Professional Butt-Kisser depending on how much they put up with their boss’s crap. Though there are earlier examples, the modern Corrupt Corporate Executive had (until relatively recently) a distinctly The '80s ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties"] feel (due to the influence of Cyberpunk), which made him seem progressively more out of place as those affectations become less mainstream. Earlier Corrupt Corporate Executives tended to be far less stylized and distinct from other "smooth" villain types (often with a healthy streak of Ernst Stavro Blofeld). However, starting with the Turn of the Millennium onwards, countless high profile real-life cases of corporate corruption have arguably diminished the '80s feel of the character and made the Corrupt Corporate Executive a very modern villain—particularly with the rise in the last decade of the Tech Bro subtype. See the analysis page for more discussion of the variations of Corrupt Corporate Execs that show up in media. This is one of the inevitable progressions that any ambitious ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil"] character will end in. See Also There Are No Good Executives. Occasionally, the CCE will be the producer of an Immoral Reality Show. If the executive is a caricature of a certain someone with fake poofy hair and lives in a giant tower, then that is a Trumplica. See also the Corrupt Politician ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician"] and the Morally Bankrupt Banker (who helps hide ill-gotten gains in a secret Swiss Bank Account), his drinking buddies, and the Amoral Attorney, a brigade of whom will be found on his payroll. A CCE will either be in regular contact with the local Diabolical Mastermind or (if particularly organised, competent, and disinterested in petty matters of legality) will be one himself. Compare Greedy Jew and Pointy-Haired Boss. Contrast Honest Corporate Executive, the CCE's natural enemy. But remember that sometimes, Even Evil Has Standards (and/or Loved Ones), especially in a What You Are in the Dark situation. Sadly, this trope is all too often Truth in Television ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"], but be that as it may, No Real Life Examples, Please!</hero:tropeDescription>
