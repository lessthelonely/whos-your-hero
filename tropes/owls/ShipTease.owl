    <hero:tropeDescription>Many fans ship. ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping"] These fans often do it all the time (context or no) especially in certain demographics. Producers, especially those who keep their finger on the pulse of the audience, not to mention their eye on the fan fora, know this. So, they decide to tease the fans with hints about possible romantic entanglements, and thereby build that emotional attachment between the show and the audience as much as they can. If the writers are particularly impish, they'll tease a relationship that either never comes up or takes a hard right just as it gets going. Like a sudden death. Sometimes, however, ship teases evolve out of the teasing stage. See also: Will They or Won't They? ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey"], Subtext, Fanservice, Never Trust a Trailer, Tonight, Someone Kisses, Literally Falling in Love, Implied Love Interest. Can end up as a Romantic False Lead. A best-case scenario is for a pairing to undergo a (canonical) Relationship Upgrade. Occasionally cheated by way of All Just a Dream or Alternate Reality Episode. Probably the cruelest method of Ship Tease is the Moment Killer. Contrast Ship Sinking. Not to be confused with ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant"] Striptease (heh heh, it sounds like "strip").</hero:tropeDescription>
