    <hero:tropeDescription>In an all-grey conflict, neither side is totally good nor completely evil ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality"]. Both sides have a strong, justifiable reason for fighting, and contain a mixture of people of all kinds, from admirable, upstanding individuals to vicious, slimy scumbags. In most cases, one side has better reasons and more good people than the other ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfGrey"]. The protagonists usually fight for this better side, and if they don't, they'll switch sides before the end. While the audience roots for the better side, they still have sympathy for the opposition, and often specific characters from the other side will be seen as a Worthy Opponent. The result of such a conflict depends on where the story lies on the Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism"]. At the idealistic end, both sides will eventually realize that fighting is futile and end up putting aside their differences to learn from each other and make a new and better world. At the centre, one side usually ends up crushing the other; this brings about peace, but of a hollow, depressing kind, as a faction with noble ideals has been destroyed. At the cynical end, both sides gradually become more extremist and less sympathetic as the war drags on until eventually the stronger side utterly defeats the other, leading to harsh oppression (and/or elimination) of anyone who holds the weaker faction's views, which eventually results in the stronger side writing history books painting them as the noble heroes triumphant against the evil dissidents who threatened their ways. That, or both parties simply end up destroying each other, so no one wins in the end. In some cases, the story will end with both sides teaming up ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine"] against an unambiguously evil third faction, who may even have been behind the war in the first place, a la Divide and Conquer. When this villain is defeated, the grey sides almost invariably decide to live in peace (in the harsher version, the casualties from fighting that villain may find that there is actually now enough of whatever they fought over for all the survivors. Ultra-harsh version of this has the realization that the resources have been spent on the war). A result of the above is that Grey and Gray Morality has one potentially great advantage: It can be easier to maintain suspense regarding the ending. In a Black-and-White Morality ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality"], Black-and-Gray Morality or even White-and-Grey Morality situation, the ending is almost always a Foregone Conclusion; good wins in the end, it's just a matter of how. In a Grey-and-Gray situation, either side might conceivably win, or both, or neither. Another great advantage of this kind of moral model is that the experience can end up entirely different between two viewers: one viewer may prefer to side with Faction A over Faction B for any number of different reasons, and another viewer may think the opposite for other reasons. Properly written, this can make for some very interesting story-telling. Video Games in particular are a good medium for this, due to their interactive nature. Can be the result of a long-term Graying Morality ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayingMorality"] of a Black and White narrative. Note that the sides often will still be Dress-Coded for Your Convenience ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DressCodedForYourConvenience"]. Contrast with Black-and-White Morality ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality"]. Compare Both Sides Have a Point, Black-and-Gray Morality, White-and-Grey Morality, Protagonist-Centered Morality, Evil Versus Evil, Good Versus Good, Morality Kitchen Sink, Order Versus Chaos, The Horseshoe Effect and A Lighter Shade of Grey. Feuding Families and Cycle of Revenge stories tend to fall under this, as do many depictions of historical wars. A Mob War may be this, but may instead fall under Black-and-Gray Morality or Evil vs. Evil. See Grey-and-Gray Insanity, when this type of thinking is a sign of a character's mental instability. See also Morality Tropes and Philosophy Tropes. Any betrayals within a Grey and Gray Morality Universe will, by their very nature, be Hazy Feel Turns ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HazyFeelTurn"].</hero:tropeDescription>
