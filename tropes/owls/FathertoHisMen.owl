    <hero:tropeDescription> This commander cares deeply about their men and exhibits it constantly ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenFirst"]. A mentor to the officers under them, they take a deep personal interest in their welfare and try to keep them out of harm's way. They would never say "We Have Reserves" unless they have absolutely no choice (and even then you can expect them to privately be torn up about it). Staff officers, engineers, The Medic, and the Camp Cook will be treated with respect and made to feel as valued as the troops on the front line. However, they have no patience with the Glory Hound or the Obstructive Bureaucrat. They will never lay claim to their subordinate’s work, and will even downplay any credit that is due to them. They will own up to any mistakes, even those of their subordinates. In the latter case, they often follow up with treating their subordinate's mistakes as Career Building Blunders. When their followers are on the losing end of a battle, you better believe that No One Gets Left Behind. And when their subordinates actually die, they will remember all of their names and faces. Usually a military mastermind who disdains wave attack carnage ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush"] and instead will plan so that their faction will have the least casualties possible. Strategic, operational, or tactical blunders are usually the fault of those above them or below them. Unfortunately, incompetent High Command often handicap or cut their careers tragically short, with their true worth appreciated only by the men they commanded. This character generally cultivates a father-figure ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad"] (or mother-figure) atmosphere. They are a source of morale, discipline and stability. Usually this is through a gentle reasoning tone, but sometimes they're a more strict (read: harsh) father/mother figure. In this instance, expect a new soldier transferred to the unit to hate them. However, also expect one of their older veterans to take them aside and tell a nice Pet the Dog story about the commanding officer. Sometimes all their soldiers are new; this will result in hatred until the soldiers accomplish (or survive) a difficult challenge. Then, they will realize that they would have died or failed without their strict training. They are often utilized more as a device after they have left the scene, as an idealized counterbalance to the incompetent ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer"] who succeeds them. This is probably because they’re far more effective as a saint, and it'd be hard to maintain such an image when he's actually coordinating operations, especially cursed with Hollywood Tactics like they are. Indeed, an officer who learns You Are in Command Now may find their troops are Losing the Team Spirit over this commander's death—though they can issue a Rousing Speech reminding them that the dead commander would be So Proud of You if they soldier on. Sometimes they’re used to make the troops unhappy with their new commander. This is even if they are good—similar to the "You're Not My Mother" response given even to kind substitute authority figures. Other times, they’re a character who gets called in to deliver an Aesop after the soldiers mess up. Or they might be a mostly off screen character who gives the main characters a reason to try and do better ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoProudOfYou"], and to be embarrassed when they make a stupid mistake. When an enemy, they are often the Worthy Opponent ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent"] or Friendly Enemy. If they're a subordinate, the villain's lack of concern for their men may be a source of Mistreatment-Induced Betrayal. It if it's the villain themselves, then there's a good chance he rules his minions with respect, and will often avoid sending his entire army to their death if it can be helped; thus, the Evil Counterpart to this trope, My Beloved Minions, will usually be at play. Such a villain can also be in the fight alongside his men as a Frontline General. Most of the movie and TV examples in The Captain ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain"] are of this type. Sister Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SisterTrope"] to Officer and a Gentleman, and they may overlap. If they are a Blue Blood, they will not care that their soldiers are commoners. This often surprises other Blue Blood officers. Related to The Last DJ ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastDJ"] and Benevolent Boss. Compare Papa Wolf, Mama Bear, and the aforementioned Team Dad and Team Mom. See also The Patriarch and Reasonable Authority Figure. Compare and contrast Sergeant Rock ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock"] who is also competent and cares for their followers, but has a tougher, harder leadership style. Contrast The Neidermeyer who is nasty and incompetent and Drill Sergeant Nasty who is either competent or incompetent as the plot directs. A We Have Reserves commander works in the opposite way. Villainous examples that are Complete Monster ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster"]s can never be this trope, as they do not care about anyone except themselves and will happily dispose of their allies when they no longer serve any use to them. Even if they show a sort of compassion to them, it's entirely a facade or it's because they have self-serving interests behind the supposed compassion (i.e. Emperor Palpatine only caring for Darth Vader since he enforces his Sith rule).</hero:tropeDescription>
