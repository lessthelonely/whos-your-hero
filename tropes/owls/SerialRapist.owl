    <hero:tropeDescription>We all know that Rape Is a Special Kind of Evil ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil"]. So what's the only thing worse than a rapist? A Serial Rapist. As the name would indicate, a Serial Rapist is a character who commits (or attempts to commit) three or more rapes, with a cooling-off period in between. The reasons for their actions may vary. Perhaps they suffer from some form of sexual dysfunction, and can only achieve gratification through the infliction of sexual violence on others. Perhaps they feel they have been wronged by the opposite (or same) sex, and are trying to gain their "revenge". Perhaps they have a psychological need to dominate others. Or perhaps they are just a psychopath ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath"], for whom sexual violence is simply another outlet for their antisocial tendencies. Irrespective of motivations, expect this character to be one of the most vile in the setting. The Serial Rapist is usually male ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAbusersAreMale"] and his victims are usually female, but there are exceptions. Male/female, female/male, male/male, and female/female violence are all possible, particularly given the existence of the Depraved Homosexual and Depraved Bisexual tropes. Adult/child and adult/teen predation is also common and given our fears of paedophiles and ephebophiles, serial rapists of this nature are considered especially vile. Might overlap with Serial Killer if they kill their victims after the fact. Given the generally squicky nature of the topic, Serial Rapists feature less frequently in police shows than Serial Killers, but they are still a relatively common occurrence, and will usually evoke revulsion and disgust from the rest of the cast â€” including other villains. If the rapist uses superpowers to do the deed, see also Power Perversion Potential. Compare/contrast their pathological cousins, the Serial Killer ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller"] and Pyromaniac. Liable to be a Sadist. See also Murderers Are Rapists (when those who've killed people are also depicted as having raped them.) May involve learning that the latest person they rape was Not the First Victim.</hero:tropeDescription>
