    <hero:tropeDescription>What happens when the people of the Planet of Hats ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats"] believe Might Makes Right? They create a civilization, nation, or culture that bases its social hierarchy and governance on whosoever is strongest among them. Obviously, this is likely to lead to a lot of Klingon Promotions and/or Cain and Abels. Usually, the base culture or organization is of The Social Darwinist ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist"] variety or the Proud Warrior Race. They will benefit from great strength and martial ability, but don't expect them to put much value on teamwork. Their main problem will usually be that they place such importance on personal power that they eschew not just The Power of Friendship but tactical cooperation in favor of individual glory. This makes them vulnerable to cultures placing more value on teamwork as the relatively weaker warriors will be far better coordinated. The Leader ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader"] of such a group is usually the Big Bad/Big Good with one or two Starscreams hovering near the main bad guy. Grunts will usually be sociopathic enough for the heroes not to feel bad about killing, but you can expect them to be especially easy to turn with displays of kindness because Machiavelli Was Wrong. If they aren't evil, then expect them to swear everlasting fealty to the hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero"] once he bests their leader in combat. (It's a good thing they don't usually switch to the villains' side when the hero loses that second act skirmish.) These types will benefit both from their Darwinian upbringing and The Power of Friendship to easily massacre most enemy mooks. One thing they have going for them is that they acknowledge the same strength in outsiders, as well. If a Mighty Whitey ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey"] manages to defeat one of them (indeed, the plot often requires that he does this) the majority will acknowledge him as the new leader. For an especially delicious twist, the leader of such a group will be an X hater (misogynist, racist, anti-human, whatever) and of course, a person from said group will beat them sooner or later and earn control of the tribe. (Heroes who do this out of necessity will usually renounce the position once they no longer need it and give it back to the old leader or another more worthy person.) Neatly satisfies the Sliding Scale of Villain Threat ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfVillainThreat"] and Sorting Algorithm of Evil. Avoids Villain Decay, as there is a logical reason for a bigger bad to replace the current one (although it better not be that Smug Snake). You can expect these groups to be easily divided by an Evil Power Vacuum or Enemy Civil War; it's often implied that should they ever get their act together or a strong enough leader to unify all of them, the heroes would lose handily. Other exceptions are friends ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions"], in which case pissing each other off is often par for the course. Or if your boss is scarier. More positively, in organizations or cultures that are good, The Hero might earn their cred once they've bested a number of enemies, thus proving their worth. Think of it as attaining their Awesome Moment of Crowning through Moments of Awesome. Not to be confused with Rank Scales with Asskicking ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankScalesWithAsskicking"], which often overlaps with this trope. The distinction depends on what type of story you're telling. A story about a contender rising through the hierarchy by kicking the asses of his rivals counts as Asskicking Leads To Leadership. A story about a hero confronting a villainous organisation whose members became ever tougher as he closes in on the leader counts as Rank Scales with Asskicking ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankScalesWithAsskicking"]. In other words, if you're The Leader because you're the toughest, then that is this trope; if you're the toughest because you're The Leader then that is the other trope. Note that a leader who simply happens to be strong is neither trope. When this trope backfires, the usual outcome is Gung Holier Than Thou ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GungHolierThanThou"] - a leader who has no respect whatsoever of his subordinates, and who controls his minions solely by threat of physical violence. A Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] of Superior Successor, due to the new authority kicking the old one's ass. Compare Heroism Equals Job Qualification and Challenging the Chief, which when one specific position in the hierarchy requires physical force but the whole system normally doesn't work this way.
