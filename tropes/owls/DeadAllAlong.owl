    <hero:tropeDescription>    You probably thought these characters were alive. ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/RhettAndLink"] NOPE! ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation"] They're not. They're dead. A character is dead; really dead. However, because the Powers That Be ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe"] wanted him back, he is. He walks, he talks, he breathes just like everyone and neither the characters (sometimes, not even himself) nor the audience suspects anything fishy until The Reveal, at which point he usually dies for good or otherwise disappears because Undeath Always Ends. Severe Death Amnesia is mandatory if the character was previously unaware of their condition. Sometimes a character only realizes this upon finding their own corpse. There are variants. Maybe the heroes have been fighting the forces of someone who they later learn has been dead for years; The Dragon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon"] may or may not have taken over and not told anyone that the Big Bad is dead. Maybe they go to find or rescue or recruit someone, only to find that they're very, very late. Maybe someone was fooling them with a Dead Person Impersonation or a really good Of Corpse He's Alive. The character may have been killed and replaced, with the reveal making them an Impersonation-Exclusive Character. While someone might have suspected that this character is dead, none of the others really consider it. This can also be an explanation for a character going through something that no one could survive ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat"] and yet coming back apparently unharmed. They were already dead, and what is dead may never die. Often results in Fridge Horror ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror"] or Tear Jerker â€” or both. This trope is Tomato Surprise ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoSurprise"] meets Dead to Begin With. Not to be confused with Posthumous Character, Dead Star Walking, or You Are Already Dead. Compare Dying Dream, Pretty Spry for a Dead Guy, and Tomato in the Mirror; contrast An Astral Projection, Not a Ghost, Reports of My Death Were Greatly Exaggerated.</hero:tropeDescription>
