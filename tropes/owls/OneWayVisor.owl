    <hero:tropeDescription>For all we know (unless we've seen out from the wearer's POV ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/POVCam"]), any of these could be opaque on both sides, but unless the wearer is blind this would be a rather major design flaw. When used symbolically ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSymbolism"], it can show that the character has an aspect he wants to hide (sometimes physically) or isn't all there to begin with. Sometimes used in tandem with Samus Is a Girl. Usually used with Faceless Goons ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons"]. Separate lenses don't count ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/NotAnExample"], they go on Opaque Lenses. Compare Sinister Shades, The Blank, Eyeless Face, The Faceless. Contrast In Space, Everyone Can See Your Face.</hero:tropeDescription>
