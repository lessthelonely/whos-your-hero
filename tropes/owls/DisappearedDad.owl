    <hero:tropeDescription>A subtrope of Parental Abandonment ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment"]: The father of a character or characters is missing or absent. Perhaps he's dead, or maybe he was murdered ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather"]. Perhaps he's run out on them and there's bitterness involved. Perhaps he's off fighting evil. Or maybe it's psychological absence — he's physically there, but is completely negligent in his fatherly duties. Regardless of what happened — and regardless of whether or not the viewers find out what happened — Mom seems to have raised her children on her own, or with the help of a father substitute. There's a bit of a Double Standard ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard"] in fiction regarding single parents. A Disappeared Dad is far less likely to have his absence explained than a Missing Mom. When he's not in the picture, it's often taken for granted that he's either dead or a deadbeat and the story just keeps moving along with no thought to his whereabouts. But if he is alive, he is more likely to return and reconcile, or be a non-entity who sporadically appears just to remind the hero that Daddy doesn't care about them. note The flipside is that if both parents are absent, the character is far more likely to be obsessed with his or her lost father. Characters who have lost both parents often do not mention the lost mother at all, or she doesn't play nearly as large a role in the backstory. It is also possible for the Disappeared Dad to not know he's a dad at all. Unlike the Missing Mom, he doesn't actually have to be present during childbirth. The mother could very well be justified in keeping the father out of the loop. When this type of Disappeared Dad is actually an established character, you get Luke, You Are My Father. Compare and contrast this with Missing Mom ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom"]. Combine the two, and you get Parental Abandonment. Sometimes, though, Daddy Had a Good Reason for Abandoning You. If Dad is dead, we may see a Happier Home Movie. If he is simply too busy to be with his child, it's When You Coming Home, Dad?. If he doesn't have a lot of time but is willing to spend money on gifts and trips for the kids, it's Disneyland Dad. If he's wanted by the authorities, then he's a Notorious Parent. If he had some excuse to leave in the short term and then never returned, it's Parent Never Came Back from the Store. No Fathers Allowed is this on a societal level.
