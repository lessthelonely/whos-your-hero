    <hero:tropeDescription>In most fiction, there are no official systems in place to protect those who are psychologically vulnerable. Nobody is ever concerned that the kids who watched their parents die might be considering suicide ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide"], homicide, or fighting crime without due process. Fiction is full of Bunny-Ears Lawyers but this will be ignored so long as they're not crazy with axes. This trope isn't saying the solution to every mental problem is to go to a head shrink; merely that there is an extreme amount of Genre Blindness ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlindness"] regarding traumatic experiences, probably for the sake of convenience and drama. Remember, Fiction Isn't Fair in regards to characters. Can be a Justified Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope"], as you can hardly expect a rag-tag band of rebels in an oppressive dystopia to open up to a potential informant and a historical setting may predate therapy altogether. That being said, protesters in the Occupy movement have sometimes provided free systems of healthcare and psychological care. Presumably a therapist must show some form of solidarity to be trusted. This trope could also be justified if the hero is a superhero or supernatural being since confessing to a therapist about their problems could potentially lead to the therapist guessing the superhero’s identity, which is something the hero would obviously be reluctant to reveal, or breaking the Masquerade. Of course, the solution for this would be to consult another superhero or supernatural who is also a therapist or something close enough to it in their civilian identity (like Marvel’s Dr. Samson, for example, though he’s more of a Psychologist/Psychiatrist than a Therapist) for the sake of professional courtesy and privacy, but the problem is that super therapists tend to be extremely rare, assuming they exist at all in the universe in question. May be an Enforced Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope"] out of a belief that fiction's more interesting that way, because the writers think poorly of psychiatry — or maybe because the characters belong to a culture that places the responsibility for an individual's mental state on family and friends. Sister Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SisterTrope"] of Adults Are Useless and All Therapists Are Muggles. If there's a Psycho Therapist in the work, then the characters will likely wish this trope were played straight.</hero:tropeDescription>
