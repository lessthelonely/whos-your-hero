    <hero:tropeDescription>The Baroness ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness"] meets Yellow Peril. The Dragon Lady is characterized by her overt sexual and physical aggression, untrustworthiness, and mysteriousness. Probably wears a qipao, kimono, or other traditional Asian finery (regardless of her actual ethnicity), often with a dragon on it, and knows martial arts. If she carries a weapon, it's usually a concealed stabbing or slashing weapon; combat hand fans are a perennial favorite. She is contractually obligated to have legs that would make Tina Turner jealous, to better pull off the dress. To maintain an aura of mystery around herself and keep her (usually male) interlocutors guessing, she would often speak cryptically ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProverbialWisdom"], using flowery metaphors reminiscent of koans. There's also a solid chance that by the time you figure out what she meant, you would already be dead or unconscious. The Dragon Lady overlaps heavily with The Vamp ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp"], the Femme Fatale, and The Baroness, but is set apart by her level of stereotypical Asianness. However, please note that just because a villainess is Asian (especially in non-Asian works) doesn't mean she's automatically a Dragon Lady. Nor is it the same thing for a woman of any background to simply be called "Dragon Lady" just because she's overbearing. This trope has a very specific look and feel. If a Chinese person is calling you this, it's a compliment. ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NWordPrivileges"] Dragons are revered as fierce, powerful, wise and sensible beings devoted to caring for those under their charge. And they were the personal symbols of the Emperors, after all. Also sometimes overlaps with Daddy's Little Villain ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysLittleVillain"], especially if the Dragon Lady turns out to be the daughter of a Chinese opium king or corrupt leader. Contrast Anime Chinese Girl ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeChineseGirl"], Asian Airhead. Not to be confused with an anthropomorphic female dragon, or a "Dragon" who is a woman.</hero:tropeDescription>
