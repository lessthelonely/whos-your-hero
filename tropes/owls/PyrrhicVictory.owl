    <hero:tropeDescription>Few victories come without cost, but the cost of a Pyrrhic Victory is ruinous to the victor. A Pyrrhic Victory will often involve a Heroic Sacrifice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice"] or people asking Was It Really Worth It? If it happens at the end of a work, it will inevitably lead to a Bittersweet Ending or even a Downer Ending (and likely Inferred Holocaust). Often the implication of a Lonely at the Top situation, where someone gets everything he wanted, but lost everything and everyone that helped him get there. A clever enemy can use a Defensive Feint Trap to trick an opponent into "winning" such a victory. Villains are not immune to this trope either and if anything it happens to them even more often than it happens to heroes. This is often done to show how futile being evil truly is, never being able to win even when you do technically win. ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks"] It is also a good way to have a Karma Houdini still pay for their crimes in some way. Compare Meaningless Villain Victory, in which whatever victory the villain had is instantly negated by some unforeseen consequence or interference. The key difference is that for Pyrrhic Victory, the villain must sacrifice or lose something they cherish in order to win, whereas in Meaningless Villain Victory no sacrifice need be made; the victory can be nullified purely by circumstances outside of the villain's control. These are common in Darker and Edgier ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier"] series and is one of the defining characteristics of a Crapsack World. Compare and contrast Shoot the Shaggy Dog. If the bad outcome of a victory is due to post-victory arrangements rather than victory itself, you may look for Won the War, Lost the Peace. When dealing with Eldritch Abominations, this overlaps with Broke Your Arm Punching Out Cthulhu. Contrast Xanatos Gambit, where "losing" might benefit the planner more than outright victory. Contrast Godzilla Threshold; any victory will do, with no price too great to achieve it, and The Unfettered are the most likely to carry it out. Named ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers"] for King Pyrrhus of Epirus, a Greek general who attempted to conquer Rome fairly early in its lifespan. In the Battle of Asculum, he defeated a Roman force and inflicted far more losses on them than he took in the process... but as he was fighting on Roman turf, they could rebuild their forces easily and he couldn't, meaning he'd burned through a good chunk of his best troops and couldn't get them back, and on top of that, the Romans had managed to burn down his camp, thus depriving him of provisions and costing him even more troops due to exposure and otherwise treatable wounds, leading to the above quote. If anything, it was noted that his early victories only served to piss off the remaining Roman forces, making them even more determined to defeat him. He was forced to withdraw from Italy, and by the time he'd returned, the Romans had built an army strong enough to kick him out permanently. Though based on real life events, due to massive edit warring ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/EditWar"] in the real life section, the section is now closed. Fortunately, there's a page with details of these battles on Wikipedia.</hero:tropeDescription>
