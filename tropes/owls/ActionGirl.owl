    <hero:tropeDescription>An Action Girl ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop"] is a female badass who is tough and kicks butt. Damsel in Distress? Not her (mostly). She's featured in far more than the Designated Girl Fight. She faces dangerous foes and deadly obstacles, and she wins. She's a fairly common character in the Action Genre. For the longest time in many cultures, Double Standards ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard"] in both fiction and Real Life meant that when it came to action and fighting, guys definitely outnumbered girls. Men Act, Women Are was the rule of thumb, which led to the Action Girl being a subversion of what was acceptable. As society has marched on, this view has faded in some media, leading to stories where Action Girls become the norm rather than the exception, such as stories set in a World of Badass, and especially a World of Action Girls. The broad Action Girl ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop"] concept can take many forms. Faux Action Girl ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop"] is a case of presenting a character as this, only for them not to live up to the standards of this trope. Dark Action Girl ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop"] is the villainous (or at least morally ambiguous) variety, and Affirmative Action Girl ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop"] is a cast addition intended to balance out gender ratios that typically also falls under this trope. Less action-y versions include You Go, Girl!, Plucky Girl, and Passionate Sports Girl (although they can mix if her chosen sport is a combat sport). This is somewhat of a Cyclic Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyclicTrope"], with Action Girls often having surges in popularity in the 1940s, 1970s, 1990s and 2010s, probably not coincidentally times when the women's movement increased in prominence. Action Girls are nigh-omnipresent in modern action films, especially as the love interest or sister of a male Action Hero. Of course, this doesn't mean lesbian Action Girls don't exist. See below for even more sub-tropes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] and other variants.
