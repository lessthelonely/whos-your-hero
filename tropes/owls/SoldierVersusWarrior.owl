    <hero:tropeDescription>  In a story that involves a Proud Warrior Race ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace"] or some other version of a fighting culture, you'll eventually have the eternal debate: Is it better to be a soldier or a warrior? In other words, when this conflict is depicted, a Soldier fights to live, and a Warrior lives to fight. A work that pits these two against each other typically invokes Romanticism Versus Enlightenment ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment"], Emotions vs. Stoicism or Order Versus Chaos, and either side can be shown as right or wrong â€” this can often be an Athens and Sparta scenario. A work favoring the Soldiers will typically portray the Warriors as a Strawman Emotional, The Horde, or some other disorganized mass of wild and barbaric creatures. A work favoring the Warriors will typically portray the Soldiers as a mindless Red Shirt Army, with no spirit or individuality. Some works may not favor either, but will simply show them as two different (but necessary) Opposing Combat Philosophies. Despite these seemingly antithetical traits, the line between the two archetypes is not always clear, and certain individuals or even whole armies can sometimes display qualities of both. One complication that can be seen in Real Life ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife"] cultural comparisons, but not as frequently in fiction, is that a more organized/disciplined force often displays more connotations associated with the Warrior; i.e. a standing army is often a sign of a society being more warlike, as opposed to one relying on civilian levies when conflict arises. See also World's Best Warrior ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsBestWarrior"], which shows how a single fighter can become the best in either culture. Compare Technician vs. Performer, Force and Finesse, Chevalier vs. Rogue, Arrogant God vs. Raging Monster, and Quantity Versus Quality and Quality over Quantity. Contrast Scientist vs. Soldier. Ironically, in the Humans Are Warriors ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors"] trope, humans tend to be the soldiers while the other species are warriors, and that is why humans are better at war.</hero:tropeDescription>
