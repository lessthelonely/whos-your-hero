    <hero:tropeDescription>A character, often an adult or sometimes teenager, has a considerably younger Sidekick ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick"]. Traditionally the kid will often act as The Watson for the main character, and/or as someone for younger audiences to identify with. Sometimes the kid acts as a Morality Pet or as a Wish-Fulfillment personification, which goes some way to explaining the implausibility of a responsible adult putting a young child in dangerous situations. Sometimes the sidekick will be a Teen Genius or Child Prodigy in an attempt to justify their presence, or even a Cute Bruiser. Other times, they're The Load and a Damsel in Distress. May overlap with Junior Counterpart. Compare Tagalong Kid ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid"], Kid-Appeal Character, Bratty Half-Pint, and Baker Street Regular. Contrast Older Sidekick.</hero:tropeDescription>
