    <hero:tropeDescription>While the Cultured Badass ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturedBadass"] and Wicked Cultured listen to Tchaikovsky and Wagner, and read Nietzsche in their spare time, the Pop-Cultured Badass ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturedBadass"] rocks out to the latest hits on their iPod and discusses their interpretation of recent movies. They may very well engage in discussing tropes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope"] and Conversational Troping, and weaponising their media awareness to analyse and solve problems. Theyâ€™re also very prone to being Sophisticated as Hell. Contrast Cultured Badass ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturedBadass"] and Wicked Cultured. Sometimes the eponymous bunny ears of a Bunny-Ears Lawyer.</hero:tropeDescription>
