    <hero:tropeDescription>A character is conducting a perfectly normal Inner Monologue ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologue"], usually thinking about how horrible their friend's cooking is or how attractive they find the person across the room from them. Unfortunately for them they were a little absentminded and started going into an outer ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkingOutLoud"] monologue - and everyone in the room just heard them say, "Damn, I'd like to rip his shirt open with my teeth" or "Yeah, your mother's singing is lovely if you happen to have your head encased in concrete." Then it hits them as they hear their own voice, they stop, look around, make a blank expression and say... "Did I just say that out loud?" Hilarity Ensues ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues"]. Note that if the character is having a normal conversation, and reveals a secret because of not knowing that it is a secret or not knowing that he's talking with someone who's not informed of it, then it's an Accidental Public Confession ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPublicConfession"]. It may lead to a "Did I Just Say That Out Loud?" comment (or a variant), but it is not this trope. A subtrope of Fee Fi Faux Pas ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeeFiFauxPas"]. Closely related to Open Mouth, Insert Foot. See also: Forgot About the Mind Reader, Can't Believe I Said That, Is This Thing Still On?, Saying Too Much, and Accidental Public Confession. May have some relation to Thinks of Something Smart, Says Something Stupid. Here is a compilation ["https://tvtropes.orghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9U-SvgMn9s"] with a lot of examples of this trope.</hero:tropeDescription>
