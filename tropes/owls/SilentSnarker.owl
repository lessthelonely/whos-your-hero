    <hero:tropeDescription>A combination of Deadpan Snarker ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker"] and The Voiceless, The Speechless or The Unintelligible, the Silent Snarker is Exactly What It Says on the Tin. A character who does not speak, usually a sidekick, who is a lot more competent than his superior, who does things most Deadpan Snarker ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker"]s would have a field day with. But since they cannot or don't speak, they communicate their snark through eyerolls, Facepalms, Disapproving Looks, Aside Glances, and perhaps written signs. These characters normally have very expressive faces to properly convey their silent exasperation. May overlap with The Silent Bob ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSilentBob"]. If the character is The Unintelligible, this can sometimes overlap with Repeating So the Audience Can Hear. Compare and contrast with Deadpan Snarker, the vocal version of this trope. Also compare Even the Dog Is Ashamed. Sometimes the character is a Servile Snarker whose boss would be less tolerant of his snarky opinions if he expressed them out loud. The Voiceless ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless"], The Speechless, and The Unintelligible characters only (Silent Bobs are exceptions). If they can talk, or at least talk frequently, they don't count for this trope.</hero:tropeDescription>
