    <hero:tropeDescription>So, there's this girl ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch"]. She's beautiful, popular, manipulative, exclusive, and... not so bad once you get to know her. She still hangs out with the popular crowd, regularly attends Wild Teen Parties, and has been known to be vicious and petty to the unfortunates at the bottom of the Popularity Food Chain with some rare occasions of Pet the Dog in between. She may even act this way toward the heroine at first. But a few bonding activities and a little Character Development later, she's the one who has the heroine's back, with whom she often forms a Tomboy and Girly Girl or Light Feminine and Dark Feminine pair. In cases where she's also the Academic Alpha Bitch, it might be her meanness comes off from feeling like she is the Drill Sergeant Nasty for the rest of the school, and warms up to people who impress her. Note that the Lovable Alpha Bitch doesn't have to be pally with or even nice to the heroine's True Companions ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions"], although she usually tolerates most of them. It also doesn't mean that she won't continue her Alpha Bitchy ways toward other unfortunate victimsâ€¦she's just showing more restraint or better at making friends. In a lot of cases, a Lovable Alpha Bitch will be joined by a Beta Bitch who is the really nasty one and will resent the relationship between her and the heroine. When placed in situations that force her to choose popularity or going completely against the heroine, she would stand by the heroine and would never cross the Moral Event Horizon (she may lament the loss of her popularity but when asked if she regrets standing beside her, she would chastise the heroine for even bringing that up and would be glad to join her True Companions ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions"] in a heartbeat). Basically, she is an Anti Villainous Alpha Bitch. Generally, the Distaff Counterpart ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart"] to the Big Man on Campus and a likely candidate to be his girlfriend. Compare Spoiled Sweet, which is about characters who are nice despite being spoiled; Class Princess, where the character has all the trappings of the Alpha Bitch (contrast that trope) but never really is one or alternatively what the Lovable Alpha Bitch develops into; Fallen Princess, where the Alpha Bitch has to lose her status to become sympathetic; and Academic Alpha Bitch, who might care about her classmates as long as they know she's the best in the school. May overlap with Jerk with a Heart of Gold, Defrosting Ice Queen, Sugar-and-Ice Personality, or sometimes Big Bad Wannabe. This trope may follow Break the Haughty. Also compare and contrast the Lovable Jock, who similarly inverts a common stereotype of a popular student but may be a straight-up Nice Guy.
