    <hero:tropeDescription>A good guy turns bad, the opposite ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeTropes"] of the Heel–Face Turn. The ways in which this happens are many: This is the Evil Counterpart ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart"] to the more common Heel–Face Turn and is generally found in a story with Black-and-White Morality. The many reasons and the probability for a turn are listed in the Sorting Algorithm of Face-Heel Turning. In a world full of Brainwashed ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed"] victims, they may be the one who appears to be but really is Not Brainwashed ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed"]. The term "Face Heel Turn" comes from Professional Wrestling ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling"], in which a "good" wrestler (a face) is occasionally tempted by The Dark Side, or just gets fed up, and becomes a "bad" wrestler (a heel). Magazines and other promotional material from the various wrestling "leagues" frequently comment on various wrestlers' changes in "alignment" (in wrestling's fictional plotline known as kayfabe) nearly as frequently as they actually cover events in the ring themselves. (They even use phrases like "Face Heel Turn", though the shorter "Heel Turn" is more common.) A wrestler's heel turn is often a sign that he or she is about to see his or her popularity skyrocket. Indeed, it is very common, once they have turned, to remain heels for their entire careers. Heels that become really popular may end up "naturally" becoming faces again, but it is just as likely for heels to be beloved because they are heels ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate"]. In fact, as paradoxical as it might seem, a heel turn can help an otherwise despised wrestler become likable: fans may well resent a face character, and may be better able to relate to a character who is profoundly flawed in one way or another. (After all, that's what satire is all about.) Note that a Face-Heel Turn is harder to pull off than a Heel–Face Turn ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn"] - at least convincingly. If a character is introduced as likable and heroic, it takes some good writing to properly take them through the Character Development required to become a villain. Simply Foreshadowing that a character could turn evil is not enough. The work has to be put in to get the character to that destination; there are plenty of wrestling examples where this hasn't been done, or the reasons for the turn are so badly thought out that the fans reject it, and the wrestler turns back face shortly after. Contrast: Compare Protagonist Journey to Villain ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistJourneyToVillain"], a plot which utilizes this trope as the entire character and story arc. Big Bad Slippage, where the Big Bad does this over the course of the story, is a Sub-Trope. See also Heel–Face Revolving Door ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor"], Neutral No Longer, Deal with the Devil, We Used to Be Friends, Start of Darkness and Et Tu, Brute?. If the turn takes place extremely abruptly, it may include Jumping Off the Slippery Slope. If after the turn, there are still past rivalries with their new potential allies they can't overcome, see Personal Hate Before Common Goals. Not to be confused with Evil All Along ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong"], in which a character that was thought to be good was evil all along. This trope describes a legitimate hero going to the dark side, not a Double Agent. Due to the nature of this trope, MAJOR UNMARKED SPOILERS ahead! In Real Life ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife"], the nature of Heel–Face Turn and Face-Heel Turn is subjective (one person's "heartless betrayal" is another person's "seeing the light", depending on what group the individual is going to or leaving). Therefore, No Real Life ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife"] Examples, Please!</hero:tropeDescription>
