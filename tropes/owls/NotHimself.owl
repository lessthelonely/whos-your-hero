    <hero:tropeDescription>A close relative of Evil Twin ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin"] and "Freaky Friday" Flip, Not Himself is any plot where a character acts contrary to the way they normally behave. Can be used to provide a mystery to be solved, or to incite bewilderment in the other characters. The deviation is often a marked increase in evil, insanity, and/or horniness: the emergence of the inner shadowâ€”or a switcheroo. Sometimes, it's a detective or police character behaving as if they were corrupt, or a criminal. This will usually turn out to be the Fake Defector ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector"]. On other occasions, it might be the result of Demonic Possession. If the change is deliberate to save their friends, it's an invoked Out-of-Character Alert ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterAlert"]. If the change is caused by poor writing or is never given an in-canon reason, this could be Character Derailment ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment"]. Compare Out-of-Character Moment ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment"] and Weirder Than Usual. Contrast with Something Only They Would Say. See also Virus-Victim Symptoms. Not to be confused with Not as You Know Them, where an established character's significance in a production is derailed or minimized order to benefit another character (usually to replace them).</hero:tropeDescription>
