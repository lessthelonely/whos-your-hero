    <hero:tropeDescription>   They depend on us to defend them, but either we're forcing them to defend us or they're all alone and forced to defend themselves in the face of imminent danger. Sometimes they have a talent to help them get through the war, which unfortunately may be the reason they were drafted to begin with, but often it's just tough luck. While the notion of innocent childhood ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent"] dates to the early modern era (thank the Victorians and their contemporaries), even the ancients felt fairly queasy about the idea — and with good reason: warfare screws with kids' heads, and they're rarely good for much else afterwards. Since the use of child soldiers forces the enemy to gun down children in self-defense, it's a very strong contender for the most morally reprehensible war crime in existence. On a somewhat lighter side, there are also many stories, in fiction and real life, concerning boys (and girls) who lied about their ages in order to serve their country in its hour of need — but those are only slightly under age, much more mature psychologically. This trope is great for an angsty backstory ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast"] while at the same time excusing Improbable Age with prior experience. A staple of the shows which focus on violence but broadcast to kids, such as the more serious Mecha Shows. It's a good way to avoid Children Are Innocent, particularly if a kid creepily sees it as a game, but sometimes the loss of innocence is played for as much drama as can be. In fiction, this also has the convenience of explaining why Persons of Mass Destruction ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction"] are obeying their weaker bosses and not running things, or at least not demanding wages and better job conditions. It simply doesn't occur to them; and even if they do rebel, they don't know how to do it properly. This trope blends imperceptibly with New Meat ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMeat"]. Since even legal adults can be teenagers, old soldiers in particular may regard them as no more than children. This trope is Truth in Television ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"]; many armies in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa have underaged troops, and some Western nations begin recruiting soldiers at the age of 16 (these recruits are generally prohibited from being deployed to combat zones, although incidents where they have been deployed there have occurred). Researchers have shown that even if these underage soldiers are not deployed to combat zones, they suffer from a higher risk of attempted suicide or mental issues. Child soldiers in fiction can be divided into two types: those who fight and kill humans, and those who don't either because they fight a nonhuman entity (Strike Witches ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches"], Stellvia of the Universe) or avoid lethal means (Lyrical Nanoha). The former usually carry a heavy trauma, while the latter tend to avoid it. An even more significant dividing factor tends to be how often and how horribly they and their comrades are depicted as dying themselves. Some Super Soldiers ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier"] probably started out early enough to be counted as this. The Tyke-Bomb (of all varieties) is what happens when this trope backfires. Compare Little Miss Badass ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissBadass"], Creepy Child, Cute Bruiser, Enfante Terrible, Kid Samurai, New Meat, Young Gun, Recruit Teenagers with Attitude, and Teens Are Monsters. The Shell-Shocked Veteran may actually be a high-school senior. If you find yourself deploying child soldiers in your war, you may have been reduced to Lowered Recruiting Standards. Contrast Falling into the Cockpit ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit"], which usually implies no former military experience. See Plucky Middie for the naval version. See also Raised by Orcs for cultures that use their enemies' children this way. If only children get to be soldiers, then you have a Competence Zone ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetenceZone"] on your hands. If it's because they're the only ones left, then you have a Teenage Wasteland on your hands.</hero:tropeDescription>
