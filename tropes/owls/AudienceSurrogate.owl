    <hero:tropeDescription>There are three things that can be referred to as an Audience Surrogate: This trope is about the third one, as the other two have tropes of their own. Compare Sliding Scale of Viewer Intelligence ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreIndexed"]. Video Games ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames"] usually use a variant of this, the Featureless Protagonist. This Loser Is You is an Audience Surrogate by definition. Super-Trope for Ascended Fanboy, The Everyman, Greek Chorus, Naƒève Newcomer and Unfazed Everyman (See Canonical List of Subtle Trope Distinctions for an explanation of the difference), and related to Escapist Character and Otaku Surrogate. Parent of Lead You Can Relate To (see parent/child relationships page). Examples below should not cover these. In visual media, the subject doing a "Back to Camera" Pose ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToCameraPose"] is usually invited to be the placeholder for the audience.</hero:tropeDescription>
