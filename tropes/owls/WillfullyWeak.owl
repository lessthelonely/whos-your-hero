    <hero:tropeDescription>A Power Limiter ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter"] in which a character is intentionally suppressing their true strength, be it by magic, technology, willpower, or just by not powering up. Can be for all sorts of reasons. Maybe they want to give their opponent a fair shot at winning. Maybe they don't know their own strength, or letting loose would simply uncork their Power Incontinence. Maybe they just want to be normal. Maybe they are afraid of the collateral damage. Maybe they want to try this Weak, but Skilled thing so they learn to fight tactically rather than steamroll others with brute force. Or maybe it's just to keep their power from overtaking the plot. Whatever the case, they have decided to be this trope. To be clear, this is NOT faking it ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverBlowingSuperpower"], or merely going easy on their opponents. The character actually is as weak as they appear... but only because they choose to be. They could stop suppressing their powers at any moment and suddenly be an unstoppable powerhouse. Of course, given the possible consequences of them using what they normally keep under wraps, it's not always a "choice" made lightly. Obviously, what is considered weak varies greatly from story to story. In some stories, they'll be almost the Muggle ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle"]. In others, they'll actually be quite powerful, but far behind the other supers. In still others, they'll actually not be weak or normal at all and be one of the more competent fighters, but nowhere near what they'd be capable of without this self-imposed limitation. This trope, for obvious reasons, often applies to gods in human form ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodInHumanForm"]. May be caused by Internalized Categorism ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalizedCategorism"]. May lead to a "No More Holding Back" Speech or to the discovery that I Am Not Left-Handed when the crossing of the Godzilla Threshold means it's time to get dangerous and show their true power. Rarely (if ever) leads to Always Need What You Gave Up, because when they choose to limit their powers for mundane reasons, they can just make an exception, and in cases where their reasons are more dire, well, losing the fight is better than blowing up Main Street. Despite similarities, not likely to overlap with Just Toying with Them, as characters doing that don't care too much about playing fair and maintaining their self-imposed limitations. In video games, compare Cherry Tapping. This can overlap with Fights Like a Normal ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightsLikeANormal"] for a character that usually suppresses all fantastic powers and fights as a Badass Normal. A character that ditches their restraining bolt becomes Not So Weak. Compare Obfuscating Stupidity, for when a character specifically pretends to be dumb. Not to be confused with Weak-Willed, which is a character that gets brainwashed easily. Goes with Conditioned to Be Weak, where a powerful character is only docile and submissive because they are conditioned to follow orders and/or fear their leader.</hero:tropeDescription>
