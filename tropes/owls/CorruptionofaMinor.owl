    <hero:tropeDescription>In many countries, there is a crime with a name similar to Corruption of a Minor, which is basically an adult teaching a kid things they "shouldn't" know ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent"]; generally things that could increase the kid's risk of becoming a criminal. Things like bringing the kid along while committing a crime such as shoplifting, for instance, or outright having the kid help in the commission of a crime. The purpose of these laws is to try to prevent future criminals by stopping those who would try to Corrupt the Cutie in this way. Contrast Corruption by a Minor ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptionByAMinor"]. See also Harmful to Minors.</hero:tropeDescription>
