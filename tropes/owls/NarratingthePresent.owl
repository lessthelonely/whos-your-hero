    <hero:tropeDescription>This is where someone In-Universe ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse"] narrates the present (or possibly the future), and when that future eventually becomes the present, the narration in question will be revealed. It's usually stated in past tense, but not always. A Fourth-Wall Observer or Third-Person Person might do this; expect them to be called on it by another character. Can overlap with Posthumous Narration. Note that this is for narration, not a prophecy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropheciesAreAlwaysRight"]. Compare Thinking Out Loud. Contrast Present Tense Narrative.</hero:tropeDescription>
