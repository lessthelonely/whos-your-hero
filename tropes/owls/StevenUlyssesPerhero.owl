    <hero:tropeDescription>A Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] of Meaningful Name, this is when the birth name of a character matches up with the powers they get or the role they take later in life. Usually, their real name can be shortened or scrambled into their Code Name ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CodeName"], but sometimes it's more a thematic link. For anime ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime"] heroes, if a character has an element somewhere in their name, they will almost always use that element in battle when they grow up. Hikari/Hikaru, meaning "light/shining", is especially prophetic. Most common in Silver Age ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks"] comics, although it still shows up from time to time. A reverse of the real-life background of Luke Nounverber ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeNounverber"] and they may overlap, providing a justification in the form of a family business. Sometimes the naming draws upon a Bilingual Bonus. With villains, this trope frequently coincides with Idiosyncrazy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Idiosyncrazy"]. Prophetic Names is the more general case, where names reflect a character's status, abilities, personality, or other features. A character who just never bothers with a pseudonym has a Secret Public Identity. See also Sue Donym for real people who do this. Compare Astonishingly Appropriate Appearance, which is when the appearance rather than the name is meaningful. Also compare with Epunymous Title, when the title of a series uses a character's name as basis to compare with the series' premise. A magic-specific subtrope is Magnus Means Mage ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnusMeansMage"], where mages, wizards or sorcerers have a tendency to be named Magnus. In real life, someone having a name which is particularly well-suited for their work is known as an aptonym, aptronym, or euonym ["https://tvtropes.orghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptronym"].</hero:tropeDescription>
