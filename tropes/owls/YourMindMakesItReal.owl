    <hero:tropeDescription>You'd think that it all being just a dream ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream"] would let you do lots of cool and risky things since it's not real anyway, and therefore you can't get hurt. Not so. There's an old wives' tale that claims that if you die in a dream, you die for real. Although a potential mechanism is suggested in "Real Life" below, it remains not exactly clear how anyone could have determined this, since the only witness would be unable to confirm it ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic"] (unless you believe in spiritualism and he contacted you from the next life). Yet it persists, and a lot of people believe it. So, if you're in a dream, hallucination, or VR simulation, death can be plenty lethal. By extension, if you're a hacker in a high-tech futuristic world where Cyberspace ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberspace"] is navigated through a realistic simulation, intrusion countermeasures can kill you dead. To be fair, certain depictions of Cyberspace ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberspace"] require users to link their brains to the network electronically, which would provide a relatively obvious threat to incautious intruders. However, even hackers who operate in worlds without such dangers may be vulnerable to seizure-inducing graphics. Often, fictional cyberspace ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberspace"] ICE (intruder countermeasure electronics) is said to work by channeling lethal voltages into the brain of the invading hacker, but it seems that any techhead with even an ounce of common sense would put at least one fuse, circuit breaker, or voltage regulator on any line connected directly to his brain. Presumably, most users do not know about such things, given their willingness to use an interface that could turn them into a vegetable or corpse at a moment's notice. Authors who put a little more thought into the matter may come up with some variant of the motif of harmful sensation, implying there's some kind of malicious out-of-band signal which triggers a nasty (usually fatal) seizure in its victims or blows up their computer. Why would such a device even exist is rarely touched. Needless to say, the very first precedent of a machine-brain connection killing or maiming the user should result in public backlash and double or triple failsafes (plus lawsuits). Some stories work around this by stating that it's that very first time, or that it's a legally enforced rule, like, against hackers. In the latter case, seemingly the lawmakers were not aware that the most dangerous hackers could and would design or reverse-engineer safe variants of the device, making the whole idea pointless. The aspect of automatic capital punishment ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution"] for something as trivial as stealing money from a credit card is also not touched. Let us be very clear: there is no obvious or immediately compelling reason that dying in a dream or hallucination would actually kill you, unless you are really gullible and you live in a world where the Nocebo Effect is much more powerful than it is in real life. Maybe if the pain transferred is so real and intense that it causes you to die from the shock, but then again, it has to be designed that way deliberately. Obviously, magic spells can do as they like, but the only reason that you would be actually harmed by dying in a VR simulation would be if the VR simulator was intentionally and specifically designed to murder the operator. This makes sense if it's part of a Death Trap ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap"] (insofar as a death trap ever makes sense), but usually this is some commercial, publicly-available system, often with no stated purpose beyond simply playing games. As an extension, perhaps to justify this trope, such systems often propose that the user's mind actually is inside the machine, having been literally downloaded ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading"] out of his physical brain. Thus, destroying the machine would leave the user's body comatose – but destroying the physical body might leave the mind intact to have a go at possessing someone else. An increasingly common justification of this trope is Synchronization ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization"]; directly wiring your brain to the machine gives you Technopathic Power at a Price of a potentially-fried brain. Most Cyberpunk games — such as Shadowrun — use this justification, and lampshade it with alternative safer but far-less effective interfaces which someone risking a Brain/Computer Interface can destroy with ease. This tends to apply to video game levels that are All Just a Dream ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream"] or a virtual reality simulation as a function of gameplay: If your character dies, it's still a Game Over. When you are Talking in Your Dreams ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingInYourDreams"] with someone else and they go to kill you — this may come into play. This may also come into play if, in a dream, a character dies, and that character dies in real life, however, this would be an overlap with Clap Your Hands If You Believe and I'm Not Afraid of You. The Master of Illusion might use this principle to make their illusions harm victims, like making Cold Flames actually burn. Note that if you're talking about the mind making things literally real in general, that's Clap Your Hands If You Believe ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve"], not this. This trope is only about the dying. Frequently pops up in a Holodeck Malfunction ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolodeckMalfunction"]. The defining feature of The Most Dangerous Video Game. When your mind actually changes the physical world, it's Clap Your Hands If You Believe, or the much darker Reality Warping Is Not a Toy. Forget telling yourself not to think about the things you see — for it will become real here. If a computer generated or magical illusion changes the physical world, it's Hard Light. When you're trapped in a virtual world, and have to win or die, it's Win to Exit. The inversion may belong to Dream Emergency Exit, when you have to die to exit. For instances where getting killed in a dream actually can kill you for real, see Never Sleep Again. Compare Puff of Logic ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuffOfLogic"] and Magic Feather. Contrast with Visible to Believers.
