    <hero:tropeDescription>For various reasons, Status Quo Is God ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod"] in most fictional worlds. Even if it doesn't apply to the characters and overall plot structure, the world and setting itself is unlikely to deviate significantly from its origin. This is especially true when Reed Richards Is Useless, making any and all marvels made by these mad men meaningless to the masses; heroes can invent amazing, world-changing wonders to defeat the amazing, world-changing nightmares made by villains, but there are never any other applications for these things. Before long, people inside and outside the story will start noting that they can only really count on the resident Reed Richards to rectify problems when doing so restores the status quo. However, all of that changes in stories set in an Alternate Universe ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse"], "What If?", or limited series. Since it has no effect on ongoing canon continuity, these stories can showcase the full extent of changes (good and bad) that releasing the Phlebotinum of the week would have on the planet. Potentially, this can either restore the coolness of their "canon counterpart" or diminish it. Common consequences of commercializing their creations consists of the following: Create a near Utopia ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia"], or at least drastically improve the world. Causing a "Science cold war" between rival inventors. Leaving the world much as it is now, albeit with jetpacks and other marvels. Or alternatively, a common subversion (and one often used to suggest why OG Reed Richards not being this awesome may not be the worst thing ever) is that Alternate Universe Reed Richards initially appears to have changed the world for the better, only for something unexpected to come along and demonstrate why changing the status quo in this particular way might not be for the good after all (usually because it results in a massive body count). Despite the trope title, massive bad change is still playing the trope straight: the point is that it's massive change. Compare Villain World ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWorld"], where the bad guy gets his way instead noteÂ Though, ironically, the actual AU versions of Reed Richards tend to be delusional extremists who end up making Villain World ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWorld"]s anyway..
