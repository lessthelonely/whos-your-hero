Our heroes have a tough decision to make. If all goes well, most of the team can make it out alive. But who draws the short straw? Who plays The Bait ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBait"]? Who says "You shall not pass"? Who buys everyone else some time with a doomed Last Stand? In other words, who makes the Heroic Sacrifice? Surely no one would willingly volunteer for th-
Oh. Bob and Charlie ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness"] both raised their hands at once. Well, this is awkward...
Needless to say this is neither the time nor the place for the argument Bob and Charlie are about to have over who offers himself for the team. So the conflict is usually resolved quickly in one of four ways:
A very rare fifth route is for Bob and Charlie to figure out a way that both of them can make a partial sacrifice, which usually leaves them both hurting but alive.
Not that the audience is always in doubt ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeYouWouldReallyDoIt"]. The Sorting Algorithm of Mortality often dictates, as does Redemption Equals Death. This is one case where Dying Alone is, in fact, a consolation to the dying character.
Note that trying to dissuade someone from (or trick or force out of) making the Heroic Sacrifice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice"] does not suffice; you must want to stop them so that you can do it yourself. However, it does not have to be the same sacrifice: the wounded character arguing I Will Only Slow You Down and the others arguing No One Gets Left Behind qualify, as does a character begging the villain to Take Me Instead, while the captive character argues that he should not sacrifice himself. Cases where one character wishes to shoulder the burden entirely, and other characters argue they can take on part of it — such as a lord who goes for Releasing from the Promise and knights who argue he should keep them on despite the danger — are usually in, though they may be borderline.
Sometimes the argument is merely who gets to sacrifice the credit for the job, with the other character getting the glory; a common result of their both feeling I Feel Guilty; You Take It ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IFeelGuiltyYouTakeIt"].
Definitely the duty of members of the Hero Secret Service ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroSecretService"]. See also Who Will Bell the Cat?, Outhumbling Each Other, and when this involves the hero facing off with some evil alone, Door Jam.
Do not confuse with A True Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATrueHero"], although the two may overlap.
