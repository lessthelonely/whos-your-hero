A scheme concocted by the resident chessmaster ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster"] or manipulative bastard ends up involving the manipulation of a supernatural entity. Such a plan may include the deity from the outset, or the deity may be integrated into the plan along the way. Yet despite being up against a deity, the mortal somehow pulls it off, making a fool out of something vastly more powerful than themselves.
Variants common enough to have their own tropes include Chess with Death ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessWithDeath"], Faustian Rebellion (more likely to succeed if The Devil Is a Loser), and Wishplosion (when involving genies and other wish-granting entities). If successfully employed against a Trickster God, it's a case of Hoist by Their Own Petard. Overlaps with Fire Stolen from the Gods where this trope is used as a mythic origin of knowledge now held by mortals.
Contrast Evil Is Not a Toy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsNotAToy"] when someone attempts to either invoke this trope, but fails.
