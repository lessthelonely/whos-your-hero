    <hero:tropeDescription>The problem with a very long-running fictional creation is this. On one hand, Superman ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman"], say, is a high-selling, successful character — the basis for a lot of ongoing works, licenses and so on. You don't want him to age or die, because that means losing that successful character. So within the franchise he must come to ignore the passage of time, stay suspended forever somewhere in young manhood... even as years and eventually decades pass in real life. On the other hand, Superman exists as part of a greater universe, and if all the stories in that universe are continuously frozen in time in this way, that cuts off a lot of possibilities. So what do you do? Let things exist in Comic-Book Time ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop"]: otherwise known as a Floating Timeline, or Sliding Timescale. You use the illusion of time passing. Certain events will happen — and will continue to have happened — before others, but you never refer to specific dates if you can help it. You let characters change, but only a little. Stories focused around youngsters are especially vulnerable to this ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp"], and even aging characters usually aren't allowed to progress to the point they'd be separated from their peers. Comic-Book Time does not pass at the same rate for everyone; secondary characters may catch Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOperaRapidAgingSyndrome"] and age from children to teenagers and then young adults while their adult counterparts remain roughly the same age. Or minor characters can drop out of the narrative, only to return years later, aged, while their counterpart heroes remain youthful. (This concept was picked up on in the Fourth Wall-breaking She-Hulk series, in which a Golden Age character decided to hang around She-Hulk as much as possible to stay youthful.) This trope can prove problematic with creations who are tied to a certain time period or conflict. For example, since the 1980s, Magneto ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto"]'s backstory and characterisation have been deeply connected to his status as a Holocaust survivor; no matter that beyond a certain point this ought to make him much older than the character seems.note Of course, comics weirdness can work around this. In mainstream Marvel continuity, he was de-aged into a baby (don't ask) and then re-aged into a young man an unspecified numbers of years before whenever the latest issue of X-Men takes place. However, in the case of The Punisher, simply retconning his backstory as a veteran of a more recent war than Vietnam (officially done in 2012) doesn't alter the character or their motivations too drastically. In other continuities, however, this trope is played straight. That causes a particular type of aversion, the Refugee from Time, where you just don't allow any Sliding Timescale at all or at least not for one character — though ultimately it will make them impossibly old as more real-world years pass. A common solution is to Retcon those conflicts into a generic and dateless Fantasy Conflict Counterpart when the dates start giving trouble. One possible justification for the trope is that publication time typically spans much longer than the passage of time in the story — otherwise known as Webcomic Time ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebcomicTime"]. Particularly in recent years, comic book publishers have tended to adopt the model where each monthly issue of a title is a single installment in a longer Story Arc; for instance, a six-issue arc where Batman takes on the Joker may only cover one night in-story, though it has taken up half a year of real time. This, naturally, is going to affect both how quickly you can develop the overall narrative and how contemporary you can make it. Indeed, an open-ended series that wants to keep using the same characters and keep them in a given age-range for a long period pretty much must use some variant of Comic-Book Time. However, all characters in a shared universe tend to inhabit the same "present", regardless of when they first appeared or how much time has passed in their own series. An adaptation of a series that uses this can usually avoid it ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation"], as most of them only last a few years. On the flipside, non-comic series that last long enough also tend to use this. Stories that take place in the future, naturally, are allowed to completely ignore this — unless the same future is referenced again later, in which case it'll have slid forward the same amount. Webcomic Time ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebcomicTime"] (see above) is a related concept, but instead of the illusion of time passing, time actually does pass over the course of the series, just at a much slower rate than its real-time publication or airing. Compare Frozen in Time ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrozenInTime"], Talking Is a Free Action, Not Allowed to Grow Up, and Not Growing Up Sucks. Often results in Outdated Outfit. See Year Zero for a compromise, and Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome for similar peculiarities in live-action productions.</hero:tropeDescription>
