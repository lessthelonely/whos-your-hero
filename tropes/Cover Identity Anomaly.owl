    <hero:tropeDescription>This trope is when a character, in disguise or otherwise pretending to be someone else, doesn't know some basic piece of information about the person they're pretending to be. This could be because they didn't research the identity enough, or maybe the disguise and cover identity were done in a rush and they didn't think all the way through. A quick-thinking character might be able to bluff their way out of the situation, either through a Line-of-Sight Alias ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineOfSightAlias"], using their Real Name as an Alias, or simply pulling the Bavarian Fire Drill. This can backfire if they say the wrong thing, mess up the Trust Password, or if the person they're trying to fool is already suspicious. Otherwise, Hilarity Ensues as the character either tries to play it straight (i.e., they've somehow forgotten their first name, birthdate, hometown, etc...) or just tries to awkwardly escape. In drama, this might lead to a tense situation where the character is found out and has to escape without being caught. Compare Stereo Fibbing ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StereoFibbing"], for when two characters have to make up a lie on the spot to get out of this situation. Contrast Conveniently Unverifiable Cover Story. Depending on the situation, this trope may even be an Exaggerated Version of Imposter Forgot One Detail; but whereas with that trope the detail-in-question is usually something relatively minor that anyone can overlook note  Such as, say, an imposter walks too well whereas the real person has a small limp  , this trope would be where the detail is so big it’s as though the imposter utterly Failed a Spot Check in their research/preparation... if there was any to begin withnote  Where the imposter walks at all, but the real person lost both legs and uses a wheelchair . Can cause a Legendary Impostor to be exposed.
