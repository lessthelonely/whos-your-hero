A Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] of Double Standard.
Rape Is a Special Kind of Evil ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil"], beyond kicking the dog or any of the other acts of villainy in media. But there seems to be one exception: when the victim is a man and the attacker is a woman. Men are stereotyped as constantly wanting sex and of being stronger in general than women. Therefore, the idea that the man could have either not consented to sex with a woman or been incapable of fighting off a female aggressor if he did refuse sex is simply not taken seriously. Another commonly-held notion that the idea of female-on-male rape challenges is the false idea that since men have erections, they enjoy the sex, and hence is not rape or not as traumatic as any other kind of rape.
The consequence of this line of thought is this trope. A man raped by an attractive woman is considered a lucky man ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AManIsAlwaysEager"], and a man being raped by an unattractive woman is comedy gold.
For a trope that suffers a similar attitude, see Hot for Student ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotForStudent"]. Some forms of Gender Rarity Value could be considered a sub-trope. Often involves the Bed Trick, Love Potion or other fantastical means of sex.

Sadly, people thinking this way is Truth in Television ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"]. For instance, some countries don't penalize sexual acts done by females as "rape", and this even extends to Sexual Harassment, too.
If a man is saved from sexual assault and immediately displays sexual or romantic interest afterwards, he Got Over Rape Instantly ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GotOverRapeInstantly"].
