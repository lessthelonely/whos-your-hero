For some stories good and evil is as good as black and white ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality"]. You have your good guys, and you have those crazy bad guys up there on Death Mountain. This sort of character doesn't believe that. Instead of enemies on those scary slopes, they see potential friends.
Instead, some characters are asking, "Why are we enemies anyway? Has anyone ever tried talking things out? Does The Dark Lord even have any friends ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground"]? Maybe if they got to know them a little better they might even turn out to be a decent person." So they try it out. They Befriend The Enemy.
A character who Befriends The Enemy is basically planning ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan"] to become something of a Morality Pet to try and make a villain or antagonist change their ways. This has about a 50/50 chance of success since often times the villain really is a loner, or they're suffering from some sort of trauma and they could be redeemed if they had some friends to support them. Just as often, it turns out that Status Quo Is God. The good guy is just being naïve, and the villain uses the attempt against them or to deceive them and get what they want. Then again, maybe the bad guy can't ever truly make a Heel–Face Turn because evil is just too fun to give up. Although we've been talking about absolutes like "good and evil" here, it's important to note that they don't have to be the main villain.
Subtrope of Good Feels Good ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood"], and of The Power of Friendship. It has some overlap with Talking the Monster to Death, the difference being that here the character is just trying to become friends to try to turn them good, not necessarily convince them they're wrong. The opposite of this is Enemy Mine, which is where a villain persuades a good guy to work with them to defeat a common foe, either by pretending they've turned good or through Teeth-Clenched Teamwork. If the friendship sticks, it's an Odd Friendship.
Common users of this trope are the All-Loving Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero"] and the Magnetic Hero.
A villain who stays evil after truly befriending a hero may be a Token Evil Teammate ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate"]. Compare Defeat Means Friendship, Tastes Like Friendship, and We Used to Be Friends, the last of which being when the bad guy was originally a friend before they turned. Attempting to romance a villain or antagonist to change them falls under I Can Change My Beloved by way of Love Redeems. See also Friendly Enemy, where the two sides maintain frequent sympathetic interactions despite still warring. Contrast, Fair-Weather Foe, when a person pretends to be friends with a former enemy in order to gain something.
