Training from Hell ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell"] on an industrial scale.
An ultra-hardass military training regimen that produces disciplined, strong soldiers by brutal methods that would drive human rights activists into a rage if the soldiers weren't volunteers. May involve live-fire exercises with real bullets, survival training that consists of getting dumped naked into the wilderness a hundred miles away, then returning to base to be woken in the dark and screamed at during obstacle courses by Drill Sergeant Nasty ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty"], anything to keep the casualty percentage in the double digits. One wonders how they've calculated the point where the gain in quality stops being worth the loss in numbers.
The trope takes its name from Sparta, an ancient Greek city-state famous today for uncomfortably similar training methods ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier"].
As with Training from Hell ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell"], in real life these methods are typically used as a selection process, to determine which candidates possess the exceptional mental and physical fortitude for the job. Training the actual combat skills that will be used in the field usually involves more standard methods. As an aside, studies show that, in real life, brutal training is not automatically good training. Armies that rely on abuse to maintain discipline actually perform worse than armies that maintain discipline via professionalism and respect. Studies of Soviet units during the Second World War showed units led by the harshest officers fought worse and broke earlier than others. Likewise, the eponymous Easy Company featured in Band of Brothers suffered similar casualty rates as other companies during combat, despite having a "Spartan" Captain during training while others did not.
If you hear the term "Super-Soldier ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier"]", it will usually involve this, often with the addition of medical procedures that have a sizable mortality rate on their own. This will often result in a Badass Army if done properly and taken to the proper level. May result in Sacrificed Basic Skill for Awesome Training if the soldiers aren't given a balanced education outside of warfare. When this kind of training is actually simply a way of living due to living in a tough environment, you get Had to Be Sharp.
