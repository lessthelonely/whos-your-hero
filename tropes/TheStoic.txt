He can be in the middle of a gunfight, his best friend's bachelor party, or a helpless witness to the death of everyone and everything he holds dear... and he'll show all the emotional reaction of a victim of a Botox overdose. They can be heroes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero"], villains or anti-heroes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero"]. On The Team he will contrast the Hot-Blooded. His quiet demeanor tends towards the brusque or outright rudeness, though there are a few polite Stoics. Some stoics may try to give the impression of a lot going on inside, cultivate an air of mystery and confuse other characters with cryptic one-liners.
The Stoic sometimes displays emotion ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic"] when under extreme stress or in other highly emotional situations, but their usual repertoire consists of mild boredom, detached interest, Dull Surprise or dignified disdain. He may be a Deadpan Snarker, or have No Sense of Humor. If he ever shows true emotion, it's likely to be explosive in its intensity or incredibly subtle. The tougher sort of stoic may hide it so thoroughly that only his Past Experience Nightmares show any of it. Curiously, a Stoic can sometimes visually express emotion through a smile or frown. But don't be deceived, for underneath they will very much be lacking the true intention of these feelings, which isn't always a bad thing. Opposed to Frozen Face, where the emotions appear absent because they do not alter his expression, even in highly emotional situations. A few stoics might calmly pipe up that they have feelings and opinions too, they just aren't effusive about it.
Masculine pronouns are used throughout this trope because quiet women in fiction tend to be the Emotionless Girl ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl"] or Stoic Woobies. Men who use stoicism to hide their pain are more likely to indulge in mangst. Either way, expect them to be the phlegmatic member of their group.
The Stoic is not necessarily The Quiet One ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne"]. While the Stoic may be low key, taciturn and quiet, more often than not he's just as talkative as anyone else. Another difference is that while The Quiet One ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne"] does feel and display emotion (albeit less vocally and regularly, and makes up for it with deeper pathos), the Stoic is so devoid of any semblance of human emotion that he borders on being a true Tin Man. Whether he has emotion or not varies, but he will invariably refuse to ever show it.
Stoics can have all alignments, but if they're not evil but really don't care about anyone and anything, they're True Neutral ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral"]. They're hardly ever chaotic, however.
There are three types:
This last one has real world examples ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"] in Flat affect, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Shell Shock.
The silent warrior has roots stretching back to The Drifter ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrifter"] in Westerns and farther back. The Stoics in ancient Greece were philosophers who believed that self-control is the highest virtue, and detachment from strong emotions and passion would give them greater insight in their quest for truth. They also thought that emotional reactions to the inevitable were silly; given that We All Die Someday, what is grieving over death but a judgment that the inevitable was somehow wrong? Stoics would later be criticized for fatalism and apathy. Examples of these tend to be The Spock.
Compare Cynicism ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic"], another philosophical movement that advocated detachment from worldly pleasures, but has been criticised so much that it became a synonym for pessimism.
Note: Just because the person is Stoic doesn't necessarily mean that person is a jerkass ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass"] or cynical.
Contrast/Compare with Loveable Rogue ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveableRogue"], Become a Real Boy, The McCoy and Gentle Giant. On the far end of Emotions vs. Stoicism. If a person deliberately inflicts pain on himself to show it doesn't bother him, that's Macho Masochism. See Emotionless Reptile for a type of animal often depicted as being this.
Contrast Rage Breaking Point ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint"], Drama Queen, Prone to Tears, Large Ham, Nervous Wreck, No Poker Face. If someone attempts to be stoic but fails and breaks up into laughter, that's called Corpsing.noteÂ So named because the worst time to lose your composure if you're an actor is when you're playing a corpse.
