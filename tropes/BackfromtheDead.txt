A major character, possibly even a popularly nasty Big Bad ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad"], has been killed, pronounced dead and buried. However, the established laws of the universe allow for Functional Magic, a Sufficiently Advanced Alien, Applied Phlebotinum, Deus ex Machina or similar agency to intervene and subvert what naturally follows dying. Namely, staying dead. (In some cases, an explanation isn't even bothered with.)
Maybe the writers were running short of new ideas and decided to recycle some old characters ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledScript"]. Maybe the actor has recently acquired some indecent photographs of the producers. Maybe the new writer was devastated his predecessor killed the character. Who knows? He is now Back From the Dead!
The form of afterlife can vary pretty widely. They may "simply" be resurrected or reincarnated ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation"] (usually as a sentient pet animal), physical or mental alterations (good or bad) optional; or we may now have a ghost, vampire, zombie, angel, godling, demon, haunted car... okay, that last one will be hard to top (except with a Love-matic Grandpa!). Bringing someone back from the dead by supernatural means is generally treated as being a negative thing because of how unnatural it is.
If a character cannot come back from the dead entirely, they may show up as a Spirit Advisor ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor"] or Mentor Archetype, letting them be literally dead, but allowing them to interact with the living.
In the Star Trek: Voyager ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager"] episode "Mortal Coil", Neelix actually dies for real but is (some would argue unfortunately) brought back to life some 18 hours later. This is an example of Contractual Immortality. In order to qualify for being brought Back From The Dead, a character in a TV show would have to be still dead at the end of one episode and resurrected, by whatever means, in a later episode (2-parters don't count).
This is exceedingly common in American superhero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero"] comic books, to the point that whenever a popular character dies, it's a given that they'll be back within no more than five years. At one time, it was said that "Nobody ever stays dead in comics, except Bucky, Uncle Ben and Jason Todd." Naturally, since that phrase was coined, Bucky and Jason Todd have both been recalled to life.
See Death Is Cheap ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap"] for when this becomes a regular feature of a 'verse, Sorting Algorithm of Deadness for the odds a particular death will stick, and the accompanying betting pool for which modern Lazarus is due back next. See also Resurrective Immortality for where this is an everyday part of a character's life.
A general rule of thumb is that if you Never Found the Body ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody"], the character is Not Quite Dead in the first place (and therefore not a candidate for this trope). One of the most common examples of this is that if a character falls off of a cliff or other high structure, especially into water, they're almost guaranteed to still be alive; see Disney Death. An explosion gives more reasonable odds. Of course, even if you've see the body and you've atomized it so finely that each individual molecule is a galaxy apart... there's always Time Travel. Removing the entire thing from existence can be done, and equally undone by a similar Deus ex Machina. A Mistaken Death Confirmation will result if another character either fails to find life signs or sees the character's fatal injury.
Faking the Dead ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead"] has its own trope. See also First-Episode Resurrection when this happens at the start of the series.
The character's resurrection from the dead could result in a situation of Unwanted Revival ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedRevival"].
Real life examples are not included here; while people thought to be dead ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxDeath"] — and even legally or medically "declared" dead — have occasionally been revealed to be alive, or been resuscitated by a pioneering new medical technique, that just means they were never really dead to begin with. Resurrections described in religious texts should go in the "religion" section for the avoidance of argument, while reincarnation has its own page.
