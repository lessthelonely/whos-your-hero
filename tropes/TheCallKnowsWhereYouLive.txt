Even if a hero wishes to refuse ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefusalOfTheCall"] the Call to Adventure, destiny has ways of making sure that it can't be ignored. One of which is to strike the hero right where they live.
If the villain or villains were not introduced earlier, it is usually at this point where they will make their presence, and their evil, felt for the first time. Friends or loved ones may be hurt, kidnapped or outright slain. Homes or even hometowns may get razed to the ground ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown"]. The hero may well find themselves actively hunted or worse. Whatever the form it takes, bad and often tragic things happen to the hero and their world, and the point is driven home that they can't run away from their life mission.
Embittered and hardened by the experience, The Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero"] thus takes up the call, either to avenge those that were hurt or slain, rescue those who were kidnapped, make the villains stop making their life a living hell, and/or make sure that whatever happened does not happen again to anyone else. Many an Anti-Hero has been shaped by this. He Who Fights Monsters almost certainly has. Multiply at least twofold if The Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero"] tried Starting a New Life.
This trope may be referenced in a Troubled Backstory Flashback ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledBackstoryFlashback"]. Villains may inflict this on the hero's friends because "They Were Holding You Back". The Forgotten Fallen Friend is the trope where, after the hero starts the adventure, he or she gets over the deaths with remarkable aplomb.
May overlaps with Doomed Hometown ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown"] (only this trope is often viciously more personal) or Death by Origin Story. Compare with The Villain Knows Where You Live (a possible reason why the call keeps coming), War Comes Home (in which the call to action is an actual attack on your homeland by the enemy) and It's a Wonderful Plot (in which the timeline itself won't allow the hero to ignore his role). Contrast with Plot Detour; Kidnapped by the Call, for a heroic variant. See also Nice Job Breaking It, Hero, for when this is the result of a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.
Not to be confused with The Calls Are Coming from Inside the House ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCallsAreComingFromInsideTheHouse"] or a character being Forced from Their Home.
