It might be a nickname with a horribly embarrassing story behind it, or something family members or lovers use only when they're alone (in which case it overlaps with Affectionate Nickname ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname"]). It will often reference a character's appearance or lack of ability in one area or another; sexual prowess (or endowment) is a common one. Because it is embarrassing it may be a Berserk Button for its recipient.
This is frequently a comedy trope, but not always; the backstory behind the nickname can also apply to a harrowing event from the character's past like a tragic mistake they made ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure"] â€”they simply need to be ashamed of the nickname they are now burdened with.
Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] of In-Series Nickname. Appropriated Appellation is this trope defied. May overlap with Do Not Call Me "Paul".
