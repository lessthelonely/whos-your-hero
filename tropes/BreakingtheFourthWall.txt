"Hey! How're you doing out there? ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle"] It sure is nice to be the Breaking The Fourth Wall page on TV Tropes. Sure, I don't get as much attention as some of the other pages, but I try my hardest."
Anyway, the Fourth Wall ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall"] is the fact that in any work of fiction the characters are unaware of the fact that they are fictional characters in a work, the audience observing them, and whatever medium conventions occur in between the two.
Breaking the fourth wall is when a character acknowledges their fictionality, by either indirectly or directly addressing the audience. Alternatively, they may interact with their creator (the author of the book, the director of the movie, the artist of the comic book, etc.). This is more akin to breaking one of the walls of the set, but the existence of a director implies the existence of an audience, so it's still indirectly Breaking The Fourth Wall. This trope is usually used for comedic purposes.
It should be noted that other sources will refer to any fiction that draws attention to its fictionality as "Breaking the Fourth Wall". Our definition is a bit narrower: Breaking The Fourth Wall only occurs if the characters acknowledge the audience or the author, whether directly or indirectly, got it? It's not enough that I recognize my status as a wiki page, it's the fact that I'm commenting to you about it!
Although Breaking the Fourth Wall are mostly Played for Laughs ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs"] nowadays, serious fourth wall breaking is not unheard of. Such if the person is suffering from insanity or goes under some kind of existential crisis.
Named for the theatrical convention of building sets with right, left and back walls ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeWallSet"], while the audience observes the action through an imaginary "fourth"noteÂ or sometimes "third", depending on if or how the designers chose to number their walls wall located at the front of the stage. Breaking the fourth wall would occur when the actors would step through where the virtual fourth wall should be and address the audience directly.
This is a very old trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism"]: William Shakespeare's characters often addressed the audience. They broke it regularly in Ancient Greek theater, too, pretty much as soon as they'd invented the Fourth Wall - or, arguably, before inventing the Fourth Wall. It was an commonly-used technique in the epic theatre movement of the early-to-mid 20th century.
When a series breaks the fourth wall on such a regular basis that there may as well not be one in the first place, then you've gone straight into No Fourth Wall ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall"].
Can be expressed using Medium Awareness ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness"]. When done literally, it's Camera Abuse. See also: Narrator (this trope is their job), Postmodernism (loves this trope), Aside Glance and Aside Comment (particular kinds of this), Animated Actors (an animation-specific subtrope), and Who Would Want to Watch Us? (characters lampooning the premise). He Knows About Timed Hits often involves breaking a videogame's fourth wall through necessity. For a detailed discussion of the line between this and No Fourth Wall, see Sliding Scale of Fourth Wall Hardness. If the creator of a work, the audience, or you, personally, interact with characters in a way that isn't Audience Participation, it may well be From Beyond the Fourth Wall.
Often used for Lampshade Hanging ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging"]. But if a character lampshades without addressing or acknowledging the audience, it's just Lampshade Hanging ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging"]. Similarly the fourth wall can be broken with no lampshades in sight.
If somebody is not in the break and doesn't understand who the ones breaking the wall are talking to, see Audience? What Audience? ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceWhatAudience"]. If the other characters are aware of the wall but are also aware that they're not supposed to show that they're aware, that's Scolding the Fourth-Wall Breaker.
If it's made ambiguous whether or not the fourth wall is being broken, it's Leaning on the Fourth Wall ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall"]. If something slams into the screen and literally breaks it, it's Camera Abuse or Interface Screw. If the characters are attempting to use, or implied to have used, the fourth wall to escape into the real world, especially with malicious intent, it's The Fourth Wall Will Not Protect You.
