Your average Badass Normal ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal"] can take on monsters, supervillains, and cosmic horrors with nothing but intense training and sheer determination. But that other guy can blow things up with his mind. And so can the villains. How could that puny human possibly compete with that? In short, despite his amazing capabilities, the Badass Normal ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal"] just doesn't seem to be badass enough. Time for a convenient power upgrade.
He may find some new Applied Phlebotinum ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum"], don a suit of Powered Armor or discover a new power lurking within himself. Perhaps a sudden revelation reveals some otherworldly origin in his background, or he has an encounter with mysterious beings that leaves him forever changed (or just for one day). Or perhaps his badassness just escalates beyond the limits of normal humanity. Either way, an upgrade of this type may be required just so the Badass Normal won't become completely irrelevant compared to his superpowered comrades. If the Sorting Algorithm of Evil leaves him too far behind, and his role seems to be reduced to getting his ass handed to him, he may otherwise have to be Put on a Bus so he doesn't get in the way.
Compare Took a Level in Badass ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass"], where a character who was legitimately weak gets a power boost, and Fights Like a Normal, where a superpowered character chooses to fight without using their powers. Power Loss Makes You Strong and Boxing Lessons for Superman are inversions. Contrast with Superhero Packing Heat, where someone who already has powers decides to pick up a gun (or other prosaic weapon).
Important Note: Empowered Badass Normal ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal"] is a trope that specifically deals with a Badass Normal ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal"] who gains superpowers.
