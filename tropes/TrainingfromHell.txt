Characters in fighting, sports, and other My Kung-Fu Is Stronger Than Yours ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyKungFuIsStrongerThanYours"] series have a tendency to go to extremes when doing their training. Whether it's a regimen concocted by a harsh (or just sadistic) mentor, or self-inflicted, expect to see our heroes go through training that would incapacitate or even kill an ordinary human. When played straight it's always worth it. Conversely, if it's an antagonist putting their minions through this, it often serves to show how evil the antagonist is.
The consequence is usually Charles Atlas Superpower ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower"].
Hey, no pain, no gain. Ergo, according to this trope, a lot of pain, a lot of gain.
Should problems during the training crop up, then the leader will vocally try to claim that Weakness Is Just a State of Mind ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaknessIsJustAStateOfMind"], and force them to continue on.
Frequently occurs in a Deadly Training Area ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyTrainingArea"] sometimes combined with a Batman Cold Open (or Danger Room Cold Open in the case of groups). For Training From Hell for a whole army, see The Spartan Way. Frequently overlaps with Imposed Handicap Training. For the parental or paternal figure version see Tough Love. When used specifically as punishment for whatever reason or offense, see Physical Fitness Punishment. May result in Sacrificed Basic Skill for Awesome Training if done from childhood. See also Improvised Training, when they have no equipment or money with which to train. See Look What I Can Do Now! for the aftermath. Compare Test of Pain, where a character has to endure tests of pain endurance as a way to measure their strength of will and resolve.
