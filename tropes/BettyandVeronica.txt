One of the most common types of Love Triangle ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle"], named after characters from Archie Comics, wherein the main character ("Archie") is caught between two love interests with drastically different personalities. "Betty" is the sweet, reliable, everyday Girl Next Door type (which could mean "kind of dull"), while "Veronica" is alluring, exotic, or edgy but has more of a mischievous or icy personality (which could mean "kind of a bitch"). This translates to their physical appearance: Betty will be pretty but modest in dress, while Veronica will be Ms. Fanservice in all her glory. As a rule, they will have different hair colors per the Blonde, Brunette, Redhead trope.
This trope is almost endlessly flexible. In a commonly-seen version, Betty is Archie's loyal comrade and usually his best friend, secretly pining for him while he (unaware of her feelings ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove"]) is attracted only to Veronica, the sultry Ms. Unattainable who barely notices him. Since Betty wants Archie to be happy, she may even assist him in his pursuit of Veronica, even though we all know how much she wants him for herself. (Less sympathetic Betties may act Entitled to Have You, whether she and Archie are officially together or not). Another version begins with Archie already in a relationship with one of the girls when he starts to see the potential in the other: Veronica's excitement or Betty's stability.
If Archie's parents are likely to make the decision ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage"] for him, Betty is the girl they want and Veronica is the one they don't, especially if children are expected (because Betty is the more 'motherly' archetype). When Archie meets Betty and Veronica at the same time — if they are sisters, for example — he will fall in Love at First Sight with Veronica and only notice Betty after she has had time to grow on him (when, for instance, he keeps visiting their parents' house to woo Veronica).
"Archie," "Betty," and "Veronica" can be any gender or orientation, although The Gentleman or the Scoundrel ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGentlemanOrTheScoundrel"] is a possible Spear Counterpart specific to the situation of a female Archie and two male suitors. Another male variant is Rich Suitor, Poor Suitor, with a rich but douchey Veronica and a poor but kindhearted Betty, or a wealthy but boring Betty and a spirited blue-collar Veronica. Sorry fellas, you can either have money or the girl.
Whom the hero will end up with varies according to medium, story, and the values of the time period and culture ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance"] where the story was made. In more conservative societies, Betty can stand a better chance, at least if the story had a Happy Ending, due to conforming to social standards and the idea that Like Goes with Like: choosing Veronica would only lead the poor sap into ruin. Usually, the hero would spend the story chasing Veronica only to realize that Betty was The One — complete with a convenient "appreciate what you've got" or True Beauty Is on the Inside Aesop. (In extreme but fairly frequent cases, he would learn that Veronica was in fact his illegitimate half-sister.)
In most cases, the loser will have a happy ending too, if not with the main hero, then as part of a Beta Couple ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple"] or Pair the Spares. Movies have traditionally favored Betty, but video games, comics, and TV shows (especially long runners) have played this trope for all its worth. For example, for much of Archie Comics history, Archie and Veronica have been the Official Couple, whilst Betty was a frequent holder of the Jerkass Ball in the early years of the comic.
When Archie is female, a more enticing and risky Veronica usually has the edge over a sweet and boring Betty, especially if the story is aimed at women ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys"], and if Veronica loses, you can bet the fanfic writers will race to fix that.
In case this wasn't complicated enough, sometimes a Third-Option Love Interest ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdOptionLoveInterest"] makes their presence known to shake things up even further.
Movies have lately come to a compromise with the Manic Pixie Dream Girl ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl"]; cute and non-threatening, yet exciting and different. Video games with Multiple Endings get to Take a Third Option by letting the player choose who the hero ends up with. Comic book and TV show franchises tend to avoid definitive resolutions to prevent Continuity Lockout, so the question of whether Archie chooses Betty or Veronica will never get a definitive answer.
Compare the admirable one and sexy one of the Four-Girl Ensemble ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourGirlEnsemble"] as well as the wife and seductress of The Three Faces of Eve. Also compare Light Feminine and Dark Feminine (Betty and Veronica, respectively) and the Madonna-Whore Complex (ditto). In a Four-Temperament Ensemble, Betty is most likely people-oriented/emotionally available (sanguine, or phlegmatic), while Veronica is task-oriented/emotionally unavailable (melancholic or choleric). In the case of a Bust-Contrast Duo, Betty usually laments her lack of standing in that department, while Veronica flaunts hers.
Do be aware that fans like to exaggerate potential relationships; Shipping ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping"] would not exist without it. As a result, there are likely to be multiple instances of an Official Couple (vindicated by Word of God) that has some sort of Fanon-based "romantic rival" mirroring this trope. Even shows without such romantic entanglements in-universe can inspire Betty/Veronica debates amongst the Fandom; hence, Mary Ann/Ginger, Bailey/Jennifer, Janet/Chrissy, Velma/Daphne, etc.
In a very small number of these scenarios, particularly in more recent times or exotic settings ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExoticExtendedMarriage"], the hero might not have to choose, resolving the conflict with an One True Threesome or a Marry Them All ending. This is particularly prevalent in fan works.
See also Betty and Veronica Switch ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronicaSwitch"], where the presumed Betty and Veronica somehow switch roles.
Please avoid referring to characters as "the Betty" and "the Veronica" to someone else's "Archie" when referring to this trope, as it is not particularly helpful to those tropers who are not familiar enough with the characters in question to immediately extrapolate the implied relationships.
This trope is also not, a Love Triangle ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle"] where one member of the triangle is an Obviously Evil Abhorrent Admirer, the protagonist has absolutely no interest in. Whilst a Veronica can be villainous (as can a Betty), there has to be real drama over whom the protagonist will choose.
