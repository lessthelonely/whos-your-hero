When someone shows restraint or obfuscation in their abilities, but now decides to demonstrate their real skill.
The situation varies from example to example. The trope-naming example from The Princess Bride ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride"] featured two Master Swordsman who begin the duel with their off hand in an effort to make the other overconfident, only to switch back to their dominant hand to gain an edge. Similar examples would be intentionally displaying a handicap, then deciding to stop the charade. It can also go so far as a character revealing that they have always had a superpower which they now decide to exploit, or have trained in a Dangerous Forbidden Technique which they now have no option but to utilize. They also may reveal they've been partaking in some Imposed Handicap Training and are ready to throw off weighted clothing.
A common subversion would be for the other character to also be not left-handed ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangeMindsThinkAlike"] and then have reached a stalemate. Or if the writer is being subtle about doubling up on this trope, that the character is later revealed as ambidextrous a.k.a "both-handed". It could also be that the character is so used to using this trope that it catches them off guard that it's still not enough.
Villains can invoke this trope, as well. For more information on that, see our Analysis page ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/IAmNotLeftHanded"].

May be preceded by a "No More Holding Back" Speech ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMoreHoldingBackSpeech"]. Use of this trope, especially in sequence, can result in transfer of the Advantage Ball. See also: The Gloves Come Off, Restraining Bolt, Power Limiter, Willfully Weak, Just Toying with Them, Cherry Tapping, and Fake Weakness. Also compare Let's Get Dangerous!. Note that Forgot About His Powers is not this trope, as it has nothing to do with deliberately holding back for calculated reasons.
