    <hero:tropeDescription>Carbon is a very versatile element; it's one of the building blocks of organic life, but it's also the same element that composes diamonds, coal, and graphene. Carbon is thus used as a visual shorthand for a highly durable, but still organic, shield of sorts. "Carbon Coating" takes the appearance of a dense impenetrable layer over a character's skin, greatly enhancing their strength and durability ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness"]. A lot of these characters can do so through some kind of superpower, but it can also be the product of magic or science. To apply for this trope, the character need not literally be coated in carbon specifically, but the appearance and application should still evoke the image of the substance. This often means they look dark and shiny in appearance. It can also invoke diamond, another carbon-based material. The main application is to No-Sell ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell"] enemy attacks. Related to Chrome Champion ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromeChampion"], where the character is encased in a metallic skin, and Sculpted Physique, where their skin appears to be made of an inorganic material.</hero:tropeDescription>
