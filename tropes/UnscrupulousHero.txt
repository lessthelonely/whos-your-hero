Not all fictional heroes are the sort of person you might expect to be a hero of a story. The idea that there is an "Ideal Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero"]" and there are "Anti-Heroes" who deviate from the ideal has been around since classical antiquity if not earlier. Since then, writers have explored many types of antiheroes, each of which lacks one or more traits of an Ideal Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero"].
An Unscrupulous Hero is an Anti-Hero who is a step further down the slippery slope from the Knight in Sour Armor ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor"] and Pragmatic Hero; where the former lacks the positive outlook and the latter the moral cleanliness of the Ideal Hero, this archetype combines and amplifies both, especially the lack of moral character part while remaining A Lighter Shade of Grey than the antagonists.
Despite this, these heroes share one overriding heroic trait: unlike a Nominal Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero"], they are heroes in the true sense of the word: when they have to take a stand on one side or another, they choose to fight for good for a morally positive reason and aren't just helping the heroes for selfish reasons.
These characters tend to fall under two different categories:
In terms of sympathy, personality, etc., these characters can vary widely. For some, their admirable motivation may be their only good trait; others may be highly sympathetic, having all the characteristics of a compelling Anti-Hero combined with the fact that they are willing to sacrifice for a good cause.
A heroic character on this part of the scale runs the risk of kicking one too many puppies and ending up a Fallen Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero"] if he can't get over his demons. Often found in conjunction with Tragic Hero and Byronic Hero.
Compare with Knight Templar ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar"] and Well-Intentioned Extremist. Compare and contrast with Nominal and Sociopathic Heroes (both of whom are more...well... sociopathic). Also compare and contrast with the Tautological Templar and Visionary Villain for villains who just think they're the good guys.
