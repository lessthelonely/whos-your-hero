In some stories, a character is very different every time they appear—so different that it's almost a different character with the same name ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse"]. This is particularly common with long-running shows and comic books and even This Very Wiki, due to the large number of writers on staff. But there are some characters where even the same writer makes them different every time, deciding to tweak their personalities as the plot demands or for Rule of Funny.
This is not the same as Character Development ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment"]—nothing happens in the story to justify the personality change. Writer on Board or Creator Breakdown might, though.
This trope is particularly common (almost Enforced ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Enforced"]) in Live-Theatre performances, as the way the characters are presented will be different depending on the actor and director.
Don't get this confused with character depth. Also, just because you can't predict a character's moves 100% of the time doesn't mean they're inconsistent. Now, if you can predict a character's moves 100% of the time only when you know who's writing, then they're definitely inconsistent.
Different writers with different ideas and understandings of the work are also the usual culprit of Continuity Drift ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityDrift"].
If the writers themselves begin to notice this, they might attempt an Author's Saving Throw ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow"]. This can be in the form of trying to plausibly reconcile the differing depictions, leading to genuine Character Development (such as revealing [X] to be the reason why this character occasionally acts like [Y]), or agreeing to stick to the most popular persona (writers A, B, and C write this character differently, but audiences love C's take the most, so A and B eventually follow suit).
