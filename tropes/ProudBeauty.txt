A character who is beautiful, well aware of the effect they have on other people, and is proud of it.
Regardless of the exact nature of a character's attractive appearance, some characters decide that if they've got an advantage, they might as well use it. A character who follows this trope is proud of their physical attractiveness and view their physical form as a means to get what they want.
Such characters are prone to parading their "assets" in the presence of the opposite sex, sometimes with a little extra bounce in their step, and may often brag about their appearance unknowingly in front of less fortunate, usually younger or self-conscious characters. Unlike more prim and proper characters, they will generally enjoy distracted admirers staring at them, as it makes them feel good about themselves.
A common plot is for this character to be the Veronica of a Betty and Veronica ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica"] dynamic â€” sometimes serially, enticing a long line of Archies (who inevitably wise up, leave her, and marry Betties). When she is finally ready to settle down, she finds she set her standards too high, or overestimated how long her beauty would last, and ends up an Old Maid.
