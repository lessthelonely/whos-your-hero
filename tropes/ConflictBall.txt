A character introduces or provokes conflict for reasons which are weak or which contradict previous characterization.
For example, why is Alice — The Lancer ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer"] — arguing with Bob — The Big Guy — about his plan to infiltrate the enemy base? Alice actually suggested similar plans before. In fact, it's her favorite kind of plan, so why is she disagreeing with Bob now? She never says. Alice's behavior is entirely plot mandated: now she can go off on her own, screw up, get captured and need rescue, and then learn a valuable lesson about teamwork. For added annoyance, Alice might forget all about it just in time to be handed the Conflict Ball again.
Conflict ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conflict"] is the driving force of a story. Unfortunately, not all writers are good at pulling it off. So we often get conflict out of nowhere or conflict based on trite or contrived reasons, as if the characters had simply picked up a ball (hence the trope name). Much like Poor Communication Kills, this is done to keep the plot moving, or at the least to steer it along to where the author wants it to go.
This trope almost always involves a character suddenly gaining a Hair-Trigger Temper ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper"] momentarily. This temper comes out of nowhere and more often than not, isn't one of the character's personality traits, so they come across as an instigator who wants to start a fight.
The Load ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad"], the Ineffectual Loner, and Commander Contrarian often carry this Ball, being belligerent and contrary for no apparent reason, or to Overcome Their Differences with the leader.
Rarely a Justified Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope"], unless in a caustic satire, parody or a satirical parody, or in cases where Alice acting out of character is itself a significant plot point, raising suspicion that Alice is actually Not Herself or whatever.
When there is some actual effect or force compelling the characters to fight, that's a Hate Plague ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatePlague"].
