    <hero:tropeDescription>Sooner or later, that something you really wanted nothing to do with is going to be what saves you. A character has some "terrible" curse ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse"] placed on them (if they weren't born with it) that is actually pretty awesome. Often, such characters will bemoan their fate and go to great lengths to be rid of the "curse ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse"]" instead of taking advantage of whatever cool side effects the curse ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse"] may have. Other times it's the "reward" for Heroic Willpower. Sometimes a subset of people try to tell them this. The idea that the awesome is a curse ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse"] may cause some forms of Internalized Categorism. Immortality ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality"] has been done to death under this heading, even garnering its own trope. While eternal life does have some understandable drawbacks, excessive emphasis on the negative side can push it straight into Cursed With Awesome territory, where it becomes another trope. The Emergency Transformation of a character often crosses into this, as the condition is considered literally de-humanizing. The Curse That Cures can skirt this depending on the severity of the curse and the illness or injury it's curing as a side effect. Vampire protagonists ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent"] are very frequently Cursed With Awesome. The jury is out on the justification ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope"] of the "curse" of Awesome being Fantastic Racism; on one hand, superpowers aren't that much fun when the majority of the population believe suffocating you in your sleep is pest control. On the other, it's not like All of the Other Reindeer will have an easy time burning you. But if you keep driving off every Torch-swinging Muggle for a generation or so, you're just reinforcing the Fantastic Racism... On and on it goes. This trope is a major source of Angst Dissonance ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstDissonance"] â€” if not used carefully, then a character being Cursed With Awesome carries the risk of plummeting straight into Wangst or Deus Angst Machina territory, as nothing is guaranteed to piss an audience off more than a character complaining about having abilities that are, on the face of it, utterly fantastic and that the audience would kill to have. This is especially a risk if a balance between the awesomeness of the powers and the suckiness of the consequences of possessing them is not maintained; if the drawbacks are outweighed by the benefits, then the character just looks whiny. On the other hand, it can make for some great Character Development if the character is saddled with something that is genuinely difficult to live with, but later figures out a way to benefit from it. There are also some cases where the drawback is just a straight-up Informed Flaw ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw"], or negated by a bit of Fridge Brilliance. The Super Mode can be legitimately terrifying if the person using it loses control of themselves while remaining aware of what they're doing, but not if they only do things that they could just as well have done anyway and are just as beneficial, but now they have an excuse for behavior that might be otherwise unacceptable. The Smart Guy may be so smart that it's said to alienate others and leave him lonely or anti-social, but if he's in a Five-Man Band, he almost certainly has at least four True Companions. Occasionally leads to a "No More Holding Back" Speech ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMoreHoldingBackSpeech"] whether or not the character is unhappy about the effects of their curse. The Punishment ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePunishment"] is an extreme form of this and usually done to someone that actually deserves it. Also compare Plague of Good Fortune. Compare Unishment, where the "curse" turns out to be something that the character actually enjoys or wanted all along. A power that's triggered by inflicting great harm to oneself ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfHarmInducedSuperpower"] can be such an awesome curse. See also the inverse, Blessed with Suck ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck"], where the ability given is supposed to be good, but isn't, though it is possible for something to be both. Compare I Just Want to Be Normal (where "cursed with awesome" is taken in a different context) and Keeping the Handicap (where the character decides that the benefits of staying disabled are preferable to the benefits of becoming abled). Contrast Super Loser. May result in a Curse Is Foiled Again or Living Forever Is Awesome. Both this and Blessed with Suck ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck"] may connect with Muse Abuse. If a character actually gets over it by refusing to be tormented any longer by the downsides of their "curse", they usually result in a case of Sweet and Sour Grapes; as the "curse" is merely their own displeasure at their condition, then by moving past it they become purely Awesome.</hero:tropeDescription>
