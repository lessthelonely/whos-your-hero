Some people just don't play fair.
Picture a scene such as a mother arguing with her teenage daughter. The cause might be trivial; maybe the kid was slightly late coming home. Usually, the mother wins these arguments, if only by virtue of You Are Grounded! ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreGrounded"]. But her daughter's not backing down this time and she may actually have the upper hand in the argument (i.e., she was late because she needed to stop for gas). The argument escalates until the mother realizes that she can't win this one, or the daughter makes a comment that hits a little too close to home.
SLAP! ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchSlap"]
Quick as a flash, the mother's hand slams across her daughter's cheek. There's a pause while the girl registers that she's been hurt.
And that's when mother plays her trump card. Before her daughter can get over the shock... her mother bursts into tears. Normally, the person who now sports a bright red handprint across her face will begin apologizing profusely or start crying as well, usually hugging the one that just hit her. Somehow, the victim is now convinced that she was to blame... and the slapper "wins" the argument by default.
The victim of Why Did You Make Me Hit You? could be anyone, but the two most common characters who are subject to being the victim are a close relative or friend, usually a child (actual or surrogate), or a romantic partner or spouse. Thanks to the Double Standard ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard"], if a man should employ this trope, it's a given that not only is Domestic Abuse on the horizon, it's mixed in with Manipulative Bastard traits too. For example, the violent husband who knows how to play on his wife's soft-heartedness. These characters are almost invariably written as pure evil. In the case of a woman slapping her boyfriend, the chances are that the trope will be recognized as an emotionally manipulative ploy, but it's much less likely to be a sign of a Domestic Abuse plot; if it's a daughter or friend being slapped, the attacker will probably get away with it, they will reconcile and everything will have been forgotten two scenes later; however, as the signs and symptoms of emotional abuse by and towards both men and women are becoming more publicized (and stories of emotionally abusive women are featured more often in Real Life news stories) this portrayal is finally beginning to change.
Occasionally this is a one-off event that isn't indicative of an abusive relationship, just an argument gone bad, or just Played for Laughs ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs"], especially if the person hit isn't very hurt or recovers immediately. The character who does the hitting won't have done it before, and probably won't do it again. In the case of children, particularly if the child has worried the parents and is now acting like a mouthy brat, it will be seen as a natural reaction toward the scare, a result of combined worry, anger, and relief. Sometimes, too, a manipulative child will deliberately goad an otherwise reasonable parent into striking him, knowing that he will be able to milk the parent's guilt to his advantage for weeks afterwards.
A sub-trope of Blaming the Victim ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlamingTheVictim"].
Compare Sorry I Fell on Your Fist ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SorryIFellOnYourFist"] (from the victim's side) or Bitch Slap (for cases when the hitter usually does NOT burst into tears) and Get A Hold Of Yourself Man (in which the hitter really did have no choice but to hit the victim, due to the latter being a hysterical mess). Related is Stop Hitting Yourself, where you instead use the victim's own limb to hit them while taunting them.
