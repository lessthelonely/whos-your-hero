Any character who is innocuously and unimportantly introduced to the viewer, but who later proves to be important ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail"] by the end of the story.
In other words, they're a human Chekhov's Gun ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun"]. (Or a non-human animal, or an extraterrestrial, or a universe-crossing entity Ascended to a Higher Plane of Existence, or a...)
For example, in a fantasy story, the protagonists search for a legendary hero of old, repeatedly encountering a traveling drunk in each tavern who seems to serve as pure comic relief, until it is revealed that the drunk is the legendary hero, fallen on hard times ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowTheMightyHaveFallen"].
Or consider a poolboy in the CSI ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI"] mystery of the week who just happened to be at the scene of the crime just before the murder, where other leads overshadow that one until the last five minutes, when suddenly Grissom finds that one piece of evidence that conclusively proves it was him. (Of course, if the poolboy is played by George Clooney, everyone and their mother will know it was him the minute he appeared on screen.)
Or, in an episode with Two Lines, No Waiting ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoLinesNoWaiting"], a character that seemed to be a Bit Character in the B plot suddenly becomes a large player in the A plot. On most Cop Dramas, this usually means the two teams are Working the Same Case. They may appear at a Chekhov's Party.
According to Roger Ebert ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert"], you can often figure out who the murderer is (in a badly-written murder mystery, at least) by checking The Law of Conservation of Detail: The Chekhov's Gunman is the only character who doesn't seem to have any other reason for being in the story (see The Butler Did It). Compare to Narrowed It Down to the Guy I Recognize, which is based more on the actor playing the role than on the character in itself. Sometimes, though, seemingly unimportant characters aren't examples of this trope and are only Red Herrings to distract Genre Savvy fans who find their seeming insignificance suspicious by itself.
In video games, such characters are always obvious because they look conspicuously different from generic NPCs ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouALLLookFamiliar"], and usually have a name.
When the Chekhov's Gunman is hidden by shadows, you've got yourself a case of Sinister Silhouettes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterSilhouettes"]. If a character originally conceived as minor becomes important through later Character Development, that's a Destined Bystander. See Early-Bird Cameo when a character makes a brief appearance well before being properly introduced in the same work or continuity. And Chekhov M.I.A. is when the Gunman is first mentioned as having gone missing. When instead of just one Gunman you have a group of Gunmen, you have Chekhov's Army.
If the gunman turns out to be a major villain, up to and including the Big Bad ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad"], then The Dog Was the Mastermind. Sometimes used to refer to a writer who constantly uses and/or is particularly skilled with using Chekhov's Gun or its variants (including the Gunman), although this isn't the primary usage.
