Being Good Sucks ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks"]. Being good and The Leader sucks even more.
Authority means a lot of things: Sure, when everything's going well, everyone has to listen to what you're saying; you don't need to do the stupid parts of whatever your group is doing; you're probably less poor than your underlings; and you get to look fine in your boss garb.
But, when things don't go quite as well — which can easily be a permanent state — it results in one side effect above all else: stress (which also happens to be loaded with side effects). That is, if you actually ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen"] care about the people you're leading.
High-ranking characters ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader"] can be full of angst. They feel lonely, because strict protocol has to be observed — they want to beware of showing bias to friends and family, after all — and because no one acts natural around them. They have to make the Sadistic Choice and can't always Take a Third Option; they may need to make plans that allow for their friends dying. If they overlook something and can't adjust to it in time, they may get their people killed and feel that It's All My Fault, and end up with incredible guilt. For every failure they have to be willing to be held accountable publicly when others are looking for someone to blame. They worry about the neighbors invading, about marrying for strategy, about breeding an heir, about the natural disaster that destroyed half the crop, about that backstabbing relative of theirs eying the throne on which they sit. The worst part is that they shouldn't even complain aloud and should reject any sympathy, as that they are not allowed to appear weak. Not that that notion is always obeyed.
Although in some cases, tyrants use this as an excuse to justify their despotic behavior ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo"]. They can claim anything from political assassinations to genocide were completely necessary for their nation's security, and might sound more convincing if they put up the slightest pretense that it was a tough choice for them.
This can be the consequence of Be Careful What You Wish For ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor"]. If they crack under the stress and are usurped as leader, they'll frequently cry "I'm Still the Leader!". Sometimes the reason for Prince and Pauper, if the ruler decides to escape and leave a double to bear the burden.
Not to be confused with the chain I beat you with till you understand who's in ruttin' command here ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly"]. Related to The Chain of Command, which can show just how high up someone is and so just how heavy their burden can be.
