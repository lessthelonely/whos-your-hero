    <hero:tropeDescription>An amazingly large number of children in fiction suffer from Parental Abandonment ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment"] or parental death. Other children are "lucky enough" to have both parents, but unfortunately live in worlds where there are no Happily Married families. For most such children, life is an endless series of disappointments and let-downs. A lucky few, though, manage to find a Parental Substitute. A Parental Substitute is an adult friend who fills the children's lonely life with guidance and (often) love ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents"]. They guide the child and teach them how to stand on their own feet, how to have fun, and how to not be so bothered by the fact that Mommy or Daddy are never around (or ignore them). If the parents in question are dead, the substitute may have known them and be able to answer when the child says Tell Me About My Father. They often tell the kid they are So Proud of You. Usually, by the end of the story, the Parental Substitute leaves as well, but at that point the kid is able to stand on their own two feet. This trope is often a feature of Tear Jerkers ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker"], especially if it follows Take Care of the Kids. If it's an older sibling who's taken over the parental role, that's Promotion to Parent. The Old Retainer may take over this role in event that his employer's children are suffering from Parental Abandonment. If an entire society has teens become parental substitutes, that's a Teenage Wasteland. If the child gets into a big argument with the substitute, expect to hear "You're Not My Father" by the time things get really heated. Imaginary Friend ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend"] is often involved. If the Parental Substitute decides to make their status official, as it were, the kid becomes Happily Adopted. Compare and closely related to Promotion to Parent ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent"] (when it's a sibling), Honorary Uncle, Nephewism, and Adoptive Peer Parent (for non-relatives), Like a Son to Me, Team Mom, and Team Dad. Not to be confused with My Real Daddy.</hero:tropeDescription>
