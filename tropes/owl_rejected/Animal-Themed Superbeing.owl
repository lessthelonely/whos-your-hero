    <hero:tropeDescription>Animals are cool! They're scary, they have big teeth, they're fast, and they're stronger than us humans. It's no wonder that the cunning and beastly features of animals have served as inspiration for superheroes and villains for decades. While Animal Superheroes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalSuperheroes"] are animals as superheroes, these characters are human, or at least humanoid. Their names can sometime invoke Something Person, but it's not always the case. These characters can also overlap with Beast Man if the hero or villain resembles their namesake. There are generally four types of this character. Animal Abilities: Does whatever an animal can! These characters have powers ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalisticAbilities"], names, and personal appearances all based on one particular animal. This is the most common version. Animal Alias: Does...something else. Usually, these characters are Badass Normal ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal"] characters with an animal motif, or they are superpowered characters based on animals In Name Only. This is also where you might find martial artists who name themselves after their Chinese zodiac sign or fighting style, and use names such as Tiger or Monkey. Mythical Monster Motif: Does whatever a mythical ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythicalMotifs"] animal can! These characters may invoke the other three types, but the one thing they have in common is that they are named after mythical ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythicalMotifs"] animals such as dragons, unicorns, and gryphons. All Animal Abilities: Does whatever any animal can! These characters can channel the abilities of almost any animal or possibly even shapeshift into one particular animal or another ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism"]. Sometimes, they are limited to only one type of animal or have to be in the proximity of an animal to gain its power, but it's not always the case.</hero:tropeDescription>
