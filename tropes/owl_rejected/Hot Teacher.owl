    <hero:tropeDescription>Exactly What It Says on the Tin ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin"], the Hot Teacher is a young and attractive person who pursues a career in education. Because Beauty Equals Goodness, he is almost always also a Cool Teacher, though hentai series like to subvert this by making him evil or a sadist. He, or more likely she, often teaches health or science so the story can bring up human or animal reproduction. Spanish teachers are almost exclusively hot. Male versions of this character tend towards wearing Stoic Spectacles ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoicSpectacles"], whereas female versions usually have a Hot Librarian appeal. While not exactly a teacher, the School Nurse also technically qualifies for this trope, being school staff and usually sharing a similar dynamic with the principal cast. School nurses, of course, tend to go for the Hospital Hottie look. It should be noted that a Hot Teacher is not necessarily going for Teacher/Student Romance ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeacherStudentRomance"], though if the show does feature a student-teacher relationship, the elder party is very likely to be this trope. Similarly, many Hot Teachers find that quite a few of their opposite-sex students (or same, we're not picky)—sometimes even the entire student base—are indeed hot for them. Please note that this applies to a character, not simply any hot actor playing a teacher, for the same reason Real Life ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife"] examples are not listed here. Most actors are "hot" in the first place, so it usually goes unsaid. You can have an attractive teacher without their hotness being a plot element in the work—that would not fall under "Hot Teacher".
