    <hero:tropeDescription>When a character grows into a Jerkass ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass"] over time (sometimes rather quickly). Can be due to Flanderization, a Faceâ€“Heel Turn, a traumatic incident, or just another regular albeit unfortunate case of Character Development, which depends on who's writing said character(s). While a Jerkass ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass"] growing into a Jerk with a Heart of Gold is a common phenomenon, especially in dramas, a reversal, resulting in this trope, is also common, especially in comedies. This can also cause tropes like What the Hell, Hero? ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero"], though whether the character changes back to their kind-hearted ways, again, it usually depends on the writer. If the transition is shown as a flashback regarding a known jerk/villain, it may be a Start of Darkness. See also Took a Level in Badass ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass"], Took a Level in Dumbass, Cynicism Catalyst, Compressed Vice, Jumping Off the Slippery Slope as well as Ruder and Cruder. When this happens to a character temporarily for the sake of the plot, the Jerkass Ball is present. The Counter Trope to Took a Level in Kindness. Contrast Bitch in Sheep's Clothing, who was always a jerk. A character taking their level in jerkassitude was genuinely nice. When a character takes this route in an adaptation, that's Adaptational Jerkass.</hero:tropeDescription>
