    <hero:tropeDescription>The ability to alter (or remotely observe) reality, directly tied to the mind/brain of the character. This is a specific form of Magic by Any Other Name ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicByAnyOtherName"], where the magic is named for some pseudoscientific relationship with the caster's mental powers. Psychic, psion, mentalic, mentalist, parapsychologist: there are dozens of names for these people whose minds are able to sense and/or manipulate reality on a level that has yet to be proven to exist in Real Life. Their powers are supernatural, but the names are (often) scientifically based, making it useful for Science Fiction ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction"] stories across the spectrum. In general, the more powerful and dramatic the psychic, the softer the science. Creators may try to build Minovsky Physics for their psychic abilities, usually by detailing brainwaves and electroencephalogramsnoteÂ electric brain graph (also known as an EEG). Linking brainwave activity to the psychic abilities can reduce or eliminate use of No Conservation of Energy, which is otherwise part of the standard interpretation of psychic powers. The presence of psychics is accepted in a broad range of Speculative Fiction situations, not just sci-fi storytelling. Any genre may borrow a few psychics without being considered "too sci-fi", including otherwise realistic Slice of Life stories, implying its presence in Real Life as well. Psychic abilities can be generalized into two categories; receptive and projective. The Parapsychological Association divides them into psi-gamma and psi-kappa. Receptive abilities are purely internal, displaying no external evidence they're being used apart from the occasional Psychic Nosebleed ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicNosebleed"] (and of course, the stance). The ability to see the future is receptive; the character gains knowledge with no external mechanic. Projective abilities affect the external world, requiring acting or special effects to reflect the way these abilities manipulate reality. The ability to move physical objects is projective; the character affects an external object with no tangible connection between them. Naturally there is overlap; Telepathy is receptive in that the character gains knowledge from another's mind, and usually projective by allowing the character to implant thoughts/ideas into the other character as well. For a full list of psychic powers, read the Analysis subpage. Although psychic abilities are Magic by Any Other Name ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicByAnyOtherName"], they can also exist alongside other types of "magic", with some sort of division between two styles of Functional Magic. Even a work with only psychic "magic" may have more than one category of psychic abilities, which leads to Unequal Rites; characters with psychic abilities are prejudiced against each other based on their training philosophy, which powers they have access to, and/or how the powers were gained. Many psychic abilities can also be replicated by sufficiently advanced technology. Characters may be divided on if psychic abilities are scientific, or if psychic abilities are fantastical elements in an otherwise realistic setting (despite said "realistic" setting possibly containing werewolves and fairies). A Con Man ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan"] who fakes it to fleece the gullible is a Phony Psychic. See Psychic Index ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicIndex"] for everything related to psychics.</hero:tropeDescription>
