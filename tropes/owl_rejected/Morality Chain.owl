    <hero:tropeDescription>The Morality Chain is a character who is the reason another character is Good. Stereotypically a love interest, a parent ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas"], a child, or a younger sibling; as long as this person is alive, their target of affection will at the very least be a Noble Demon. There is no Restraining Bolt ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt"] involved; this person is the only thing preventing someone from doing worse things, perhaps to the extreme that they'd happily kill their "friends" and family. (One wonders whether such a form of "goodness" has much value in it until one remembers that it keeps them from killing their friends and family.) If a Morality Chain were to fall ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero"], commit betrayal, or get seriously hurt or die, there is nothing to prevent a Face–Heel Turn from happening fast and hard. This is more than the Roaring Rampage of Revenge; everyone has to suffer. A similar, and often confused with, trope is the Morality Pet ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet"]. The difference between the two is subtle: A morality pet is a character who redeems a villain. The villain's affection for the pet starts them down the path of good, and even should the pet get hurt the villain will most likely behave as a hero (or anti-hero) in seeking their revenge or protecting the pet. By contrast, the morality chain keeps an otherwise anti-heroic character (such as a Sociopathic Hero) from going full villain. The loss of the chain would spell doom for any involved party, and likely anyone nearby as well. In a nutshell: A morality pet turns a bad guy good; a morality chain stops a good guy from turning bad. That said, the two tropes can certainly overlap: if the character redeems a villain and then also helps keep them from slipping back to evil, they are both a Morality Pet ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet"] and a Morality Chain. Or to put it another way: The Morality Pet ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet"] causes a Heel–Face Turn; the Morality Chain prevents a Face–Heel Turn. In this sense, the two are actually Opposite Tropes despite their close similarities. Sometimes this is Inverted ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope"]. The death of the Morality Chain can motivate the target of affection to become more determined to be good to honor their memory. Usually in these cases the cause of death is either natural, or because of a villain (especially if it's a buddy of theirs that the Morality Chain had disapproved of). Now, if the cause of death is their loved one, either through an accident or because they Kicked the Morality Pet, then they may either go comatose or crazy.
