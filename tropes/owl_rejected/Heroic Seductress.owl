    <hero:tropeDescription>Sex often has a bad reputation in fiction ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvil"]. Often, the only characters allowed to have any sort of sex appeal are not the ones for whom we're meant to root. Character types like The Vamp and the Femme Fatale run amok, doing their evil work, ruining lives, and corrupting men into doing nasty things. A gorgeous Succubus uses her appeal to lure men to their doom. But not every sexy girl in fiction is evil. Some of them are downright heroic; and not despite their sexiness, but because of it. They're the ones who use sex as a tool or means to achieve a goal, the same way the vamp or femme fatale might, the difference being that their goals are good. Here are a few ways the trope can manifest: Compare Good Bad Girl ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadGirl"]. Contrast with The Vamp ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp"], who uses sex to corrupt. Also contrast with Femme Fatale, who uses sex to manipulate for purely selfish, often villainous ends. Contrast the Madonna-Whore Complex, which states that sexually active women cannot be considered "good" in any way. Frequently crosses with Hooker with a Heart of Gold ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookerWithAHeartOfGold"], Ethical Slut, and High-Class Call Girl. Sometimes even My Girl Is a Slut. Every example of female-initiated Sexâ€“Face Turn featured someone in this role.</hero:tropeDescription>
