    <hero:tropeDescription>This is a character who would, could, or has bedded anything. By "anything" we mean absolutely anything, up to and including the bed itself. The Extreme Omnisexual isn't necessarily limited to chasing after humans or humanoids; targets of their affections can also include other species ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance"], robots, or even animals and inanimate objects. This person is often a Lovable Sex Maniac ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac"], a depraved villain or is just really, really desperate. Constrast Celibate Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero"]. See also Really Gets Around for the restricted to humans (or at most to humanoids) and usually-straight version. Compare Extreme Omnivore (the dietary counterpart).</hero:tropeDescription>
