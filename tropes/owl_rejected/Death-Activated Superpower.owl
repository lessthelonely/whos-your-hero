    <hero:tropeDescription>Winning the Super Power Lottery ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPowerLottery"] is a good thing, right? Well, unless you're Blessed with Suck or Cursed with Awesome. But what happens when you're a Differently Powered Individual whose powers only activate upon your death? Kind of a downer, huh? Well, depending on whether death is permanent in your setting, or not so permanent, it can range from bad to downright awful. Fortunately (for the persons possessing these powers), permanent death is in the minority regarding this trope. But if it is permanent, it obviously won't be a useful power during their lifetime, so the real question is: what does it mean for the rest of the world? This could mean that Death Is the Only Option ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsTheOnlyOption"]. Super-Trope to Auto-Revive, and overlaps with Resurrective Immortality, since many people with that power only seem to find out the first time they "die". Compare Came Back Strong, which needn't be lethal, and Traumatic Superpower Awakening, which needn't even be physically damaging. See also My Death Is Only The Beginning and Thanatos Gambit, when the character actually stays dead. When used offensively, this is an example of Taking You with Me ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe"]. Compare Die or Fly for when coming close to death activates your power. May overlap with Dead Man's Switch. When used within tabletop and video gameplay, this can overlap with Death as Game Mechanic.</hero:tropeDescription>
