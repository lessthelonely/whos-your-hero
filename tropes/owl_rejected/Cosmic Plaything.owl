    <hero:tropeDescription>Most of us believe that our decisions have some influence on our lives. We think we are in control, but sometimes, there's the sneaking suspicion that an influence doesn't like us ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw"], or maybe it does like us, but only in an abusive way. Their destiny is to be the universe's Butt-Monkey to an extreme degree until the day they die. These characters don't just suspect, they know. For some strange reason, they find their lives governed by events and rules that defy coincidence and logical explanation. They might figure out some of the "rules", like the what and the where, but the how and the why is a complete mystery. The nature of such a situation allows a certain flexibility to writers, as they don't have to think too hard about why this is happening or if the character's belief in their situation is correct ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlindness"], allowing them to focus on the immediate story. Often includes a Smite Me, O Mighty Smiter ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmiteMeOMightySmiter"]. May overlap with Powers That Be, but a real confirmation or sign is not necessary. All that is necessary is the belief that a specific entity or group is working on the character. It may also overlap Can't Get Away with Nuthin', if the character interprets the situation as an active, immutable force on them personally, rather than "how the world works" for everyone. If there's more than one cosmic entity and the other one guides another character into antagonizing the first, it's a Cosmic Chess Game. If the cosmic entity is incomprehensible and it brought a grand scale horror upon the universe, it's a Cosmic Horror Story. Compare Born Unlucky ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky"], Weirdness Magnet, No Fourth Wall, and Hellistics. May be caused by a "Truman Show" Plot. Played for Laughs with The Chew Toy. For a more subjective version, see Designated Monkey. Would often includes elements of Contrived Coincidence and Tempting Fate. If the character arguably deserves mistreatment by the universe, they might be the victim of Laser-Guided Karma, an Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain, or a Jerkass Woobie. Opposite trope of Karma Houdini ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini"] on the karmic scale. Frequently the target of a Karmic Misfire. No Real Life Examples, Please! ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/NoRealLifeExamplesPlease"] This trope obviously shouldn't present real-life examples.</hero:tropeDescription>
