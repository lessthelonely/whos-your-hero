    <hero:tropeDescription>Patriotism is an emotional attachment to one's perceived people(s) and homeland(s) ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PoliticalIdeologies"], though people have used the word differently over time and in various contexts. In the twentieth century it was also understood as devotion to one's nation(-state). How patriotism is portrayed in fiction oscillates between two poles, both of which stand on opposite sides of Individualism vs. Collectivism. Patriotism is Good A patriot cares for their people over their people's nation ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PoliticalIdeologies"]: they treasure their people, but would never do evil in their name if it could be helped. Individual people have personalities and worth of their own; nations don't. Nations are just groupings of peoples, communities, and cultures, like paintings on a wall. Nations aren't worthy of love or devotion without the context of the people and communities that compose them. Their 'patriotism' comes from a love of their people and way of life, as well as a deep concern for their welfare. They want their people to be prosperous and happy, and if push comes to shove, they will gladly sacrifice their nation's prestige to ensure that they are. They hate war and are otherwise ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo"] reluctant to fight because they care about their people's wellbeing and want to minimize the harm done to them, even if that means waging war. This tends to be mostly seen as a Forgotten Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenTrope"] in modern media, though it fluctuates depending on the time period and place. It still pops up occasionally (often subverting nationalist ideas of what makes someone patriotic, à la A Few Good Men, or the other attributes associated with patriotism, à la Forrest Gump). My Country, Right or Wrong usually tends to fall under here. Patriotism is Bad A patriot cares for their nation over their nation's people ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PoliticalIdeologies"]: they prize their loyalty to their nation above all else, and would do absolutely anything for it (however reluctantly or gladly). Nations have characteristics and worth of their own; individual people don't. Individual people, communities, and cultures are just disposable, unremarkable components of the nation, like the cells of a body. They aren't worthy of love and devotion like the nation is. Their "patriotism" comes from a devotion to their nation and its power, and a deep concern for its prestige at the expense of their own countrymen. They want their nation to be powerful and respected, and if push comes to shove, they will gladly sacrifice their nation's people to ensure that it has them. They love war because they care about their nation's power and image and want to enhance them by any means, especially if that means waging war. This is a common trope in modern media thanks to the apotheosis of nationalism in the twentieth century and the enduring strength of nationalism to this day. It is usually played straight and embodied by such characters as the Sociopathic Soldier ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicSoldier"], Colonel Kilgore, or General Ripper. They are often a Tautological Templar who believes that the actions of their country are justified by virtue of being their country. Patriotism is Good and Bad Every now and then you get a mix, where the blowhard is genuinely loyal and commendable, despite his enthusiasm ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice"] for wars with other peoples — though genocidal warmongers don't tend to feature in this category. On the other hand, the various strains of nationalism tend to lead writers to portray patriotism towards a certain state (i.e. their own) as good while patriotism towards all others is bad. When done right, it can be respectful of other patriotisms and nationalism while providing a more nuanced take of the concept. Done poorly, however, this can also be a source of Misplaced Nationalism ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MisplacedNationalism"] and Flame Bait. This basically becomes the Sliding Scale of Patriotism vs Jingoism ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism"]. These poles can and often do reflect the personal political philosophy of the writer (and, contrary to what the stereotypes would have one believe, being right-wing does not necessarily make one more jingoistic, nor does being left-wing necessarily make one less patriotic). We can observe, though, that there are sometimes direct relationships between the popularity of a war and the number of noble or oafish patriots portrayed, which leads to the idea that the trope is cyclic ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyclicTrope"]. The writer may just be putting up a character in response to the mood of the public. Of course, films like Lions for Lambs, which lambaste the war they portray and yet were massive flops at the box office, provide a big counterpoint to that theory. Regardless of the motives, the Super Patriot is often a General Ripper ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper"] or the Hero of Another Story. Captain Geographic ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainGeographic"] often is like this. It should be pointed out that this is far from being mainly an American idea, however, different cultures have different attitudes toward it. For example in British television ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishTellyTropes"], or in fact most other British media published after 1918, Patriotic Fervor is pretty much always an unsympathetic trait, usually played for laughs. (British media produced before 1918, on the other hand, do exactly the opposite.) Where the line is drawn between regular patriotism and fervor is also very different; what most Americans would consider normal patriotism would be seen as jingoism among most Germans, for example. See Misplaced Nationalism ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MisplacedNationalism"] for the internet equivalent. See My Country, Right or Wrong for when someone allows Patriotic Fervor to convince themselves that aiding an evil leader is their "duty". See My Country Tis of Thee That I Sting for artists who criticize their own country. Expect a Flag Drop if a character with this makes a speech. See also Propaganda Piece.</hero:tropeDescription>
