    <hero:tropeDescription>Congratulations! As a creator who has originated a successful project, you've made it to the top of the Show Business ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowBusiness"] heap, or maybe just the middle. And now that you're there, your bosses will treat you fair... right? Well... not necessarily. While you might be treated with respect (or even deference ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors"]), it's luck of the draw. Chances are you'll still be subject to censorship, invoked Executive Meddling, and all sorts of ripoffs. And since you signed a contract, you have no choice but to suffer in silence and put up with it... ...but there's a way out. You can use your creativity to let the world know how you really feel. Better yet, you can make your protests part of the very work that's enriching your employers! They may be mad, but what can they do about it? Talk about Laser-Guided Karma ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma"]! This trope is about the creator(s) of a work making jokes at the expense of the company funding that work. It can happen when an embittered creator, or one cynical of the morality of the entertainment industry, inserts into their work a thinly disguised slap to the face of the company that employs them, usually for unsatisfactory royalties or advance payments. In American television, the favorite target out of the Big Four Networks seems to be FOX ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX"], although all networks are Acceptable Targets at some point or another. NBC has seemed to encourage it since about 2006, right around when it became the Butt-Monkey of the four major networks - and also right around the time 30 Rock started getting a lot of mileage out of the non-stop mockery. A sister trope to Take That! ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat"] and Writer Revolt. Related to Take That, Audience!. Often overlaps with Self-Deprecation (unless the author is even more correct than he believes about his employers being flawed). Remembering who wears the pants can combine this with End-of-Series Awareness.</hero:tropeDescription>
