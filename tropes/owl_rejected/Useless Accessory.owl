    <hero:tropeDescription>An accessory which characters never actually use, but which is noticeable enough that they must consciously choose to wear it. For example, a Discredited Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope"] from The Dark Age of Comic Books was superhero costumes featuring a large number of pouch-covered belts and harnesses - which never actually seemed to be used, since most of these heroes relied on their powers rather than on gadgets. This is a Super-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTrope"] to the following tropes: Compare with Chekov's Gun ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/ChekovsGun"] (not to be confused with Chekhov's Gun). Also related to Cosmetic Award and Badass Bandolier. A Set Bonus can make such an item a subversion.</hero:tropeDescription>
