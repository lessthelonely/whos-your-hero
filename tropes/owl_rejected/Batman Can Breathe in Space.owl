    <hero:tropeDescription>Find yourself in space without a spacesuit? Not a problem! Those supposed hazards of the "unforgiving" vacuum of space just never show up. Ordinary people can breathe just fine in space, and you can take a spacewalk in your underwear if you don't mind being a bit chilly ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsCold"]. For those worried about oxygen, the most you'll need is an oxygen mask, but an upside-down fishbowl on your head will often do in a pinch. You don't need a "can-breathe-in-space" power, it doesn't need to be explained, and you certainly don't need a spacesuit. It makes you wonder why astronauts bothered with them in the first place. In Real Life ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife"], space exposure is dangerous. Suffocation is the greatest concern, followed closely behind by your internal fluids boiling away due to the low pressure, and radiation from high-energy wavelengths that the atmosphere normally absorbs. It is also recommended to not hold your breath, as the internal pressure could cause your lungs to rupture. That said, humans can theoretically survive in space for a minute or two, if they can be rescued (by which point they would likely be unconscious) and given medical assistance afterwards. Superpowers complicate the situation. This is about how ordinary people don't need spacesuits in space. Single-Power Superheroes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinglePowerSuperheroes"] are usually close enough to normal to count, but characters with Nigh-Invulnerable powers, Bizarre Alien Biology, and magic powers aren't "normal" enough for this trope. Their survival can be Handwaved away as part of their abilities. This trope is for when characters with no relevant powers are exposed to the vacuum of space without protection and suffer no negative consequences. Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] to The Needless, because the character is somehow protected from dangers that would be lethal to human beings, and to Artistic License â€“ Space, because these outer space inaccuracies are in service of the story. Compare Space Is Noisy, where sound is conveyed via vacuum in the same way as sound is conveyed through atmosphere, allowing the characters to talk to one another. Contrast Explosive Decompression, where being exposed to a vacuum will quickly make you explode due to the air inside your body trying to expand and fill the void. A work featuring this trope tends to rank as softer on the Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SlidingScale/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness"].</hero:tropeDescription>
