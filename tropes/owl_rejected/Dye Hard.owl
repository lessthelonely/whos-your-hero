    <hero:tropeDescription>When a media personality has dyed hair so often ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaleidoscopeHair"], or for so long, it becomes an integral part of their whole characterization, to the point that it can be jarring to see them or their actor with their natural color. Do not confuse with Dyeing for Your Art ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyeingForYourArt"], which is when other physical characteristics are deliberately altered to fit the demands of the producers. Though it could overlap as some actors may prefer the new hair color such as Ashley Tisdale and Emma Stone who have long stayed with the color that they were required to change to. Named as a pun ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/PunnyTropeNames"] on the film series Die Hard.</hero:tropeDescription>
