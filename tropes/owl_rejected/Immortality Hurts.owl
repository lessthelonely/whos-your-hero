    <hero:tropeDescription>Immortality seems to be one of those things that needs a bunch of Required Secondary Powers ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers"] not to become a curse. If you don't have some kind of healing factor or resistance to injury, you have an eternity's worth of opportunities to get horribly maimed, and if anyone else finds out that you're immortal, they won't think twice about putting you through things that would (painfully) kill an ordinary human being, again and again and again. And even if you do somehow manage to avoid getting horribly mutilated, escaping the ravages of time is another matter entirely. And even if you do get a fully effective healing factor, the fact that those wounds will all heal back doesn't make them any less painful when they happen. This trope is about what happens when the vaunted promise of immortality backfires in painful fashion. This can range from surviving experiences that aren't meant to be lived through all the way up to cases where something that would ordinarily be decisively fatal instead leaves the victim alive, conscious, and utterly beyond help or hope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream"]. Sometimes this is inflicted on someone deliberately as a punishment; of course, this rarely works out as planned. A subtrope of Who Wants to Live Forever? ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever"]. Often comes with Healing Factor to ensure Good Thing You Can Heal comes into play. Compare Age Without Youth, where immortality doesn't cover aging, and Wound That Will Not Heal, where any pain inflicted becomes permanent. If none of these things are a problem, then Living Forever Is Awesome.</hero:tropeDescription>
