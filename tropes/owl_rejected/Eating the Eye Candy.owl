    <hero:tropeDescription>There's just something completely gorgeous about that other character. The character just can't help but stare and drool over their gleaming smile, sapphire eyes, or any other attractive features. Even if this character declares that she Does Not Like Men ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen"], expect them to be unable to stop themselves from noticing how well-built that character over there is, and how compelling their eyes are... Sometimes their inner monologue will devolve into Purple Prose. This trope is usually identified with Love at First Sight ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight"]. Some cases may result in Distracted by the Sexy, eventually leading to Longing Looks once romance enters the picture. Male Gaze ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze"] and Female Gaze are related, but distinct, as they are concerned with how a work is presented to the audience (i.e., presuming the viewer will come from a male or female perspective, respectively). Eating The Eye Candy refers to a character's interest (which can, however, carry over into framing and presentation). Gender-inverted examples exist for both tropes. Subjected to Double Standard since Female Gaze doesn't carry the implications of Male Gaze ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze"]: a woman who looks at a man sexually is more often than not written as "cute" (blushing and swooning), whereas a man looking at a woman sexually is commonly written as "vulgar" and "predatory" (making rude remarks and even hooting). Can be used quizzically in combination with Admiring the Poster, All Women Are Lustful, Bigger Is Better in Bed, Briefs Boasting, Chippendales Dancers, Covert Pervert, Female Gaze, Guy on Guy Is Hot, Long-Haired Pretty Boy, Lust Object, Reaction Shot, Male Frontal Nudity, Muscle Beach Bum, Shirtless Scene, Walking Shirtless Scene, Workout Fanservice, Yaoi Fangirl, Beautiful Dreamer and Stuffy Old Songs About the Buttocks. A cross between Head-Turning Beauty ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadTurningBeauty"], Ms. Fanservice or Mr. Fanservice and the Gaze tropes.</hero:tropeDescription>
