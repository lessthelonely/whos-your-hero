    <hero:tropeDescription>Two lovers—often but not always teenagers—doomed to be kept apart no matter how hard they struggle to be together. It may be Fate ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo"], or fatally-Feuding Families, or it may be something as mundane as a few hundred miles' separation, but something will always be in their way. Often, the two can only be Together in Death. William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is the most famous example (and the Trope Namer), but the archetype dates at least as far back as Mesopotamian Mythology and Egyptian Mythology, making it Older Than Dirt. In modern times, the term "star-crossed" is often unknowingly misused to mean lovers who are meant to be together. It means just the opposite — the stars (i.e. destiny or the heavens) have ruled against them, or "crossed" their plan. Compare the word "disaster," ["https://tvtropes.orghttp://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=disaster"] which has the etymology "away; without" ("dis") + "star; planet" ("aster"). Then again, if the stars rule that much, they probably decreed the love as well as the impossibility, making the stars capricious and cruel at the very least. It also refers to destiny and the inevitability of the two characters' paths crossing each other. It usually, but not always, refers to unlucky outcomes, since Romeo and Juliet's affair ended tragically. Furthermore, it may connote that the lovers entered into their union without sufficient forethought or preparation, that they did not have adequate knowledge of each other, or that they were not thinking rationally (because they were being controlled by fate). One common version of this trope, Love Above One's Station ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptownGirl"] (i.e., being in love with someone from a different social class), is at least discredited if not actually dead and buried in contemporary settings, but was very much true in the past, and can still work when applied to historical settings. While it's difficult even today to have a relationship with someone from a very different background, in the old days, it was all but impossible: if you were from the lower class and courted your "better", you'd be treated with the vilest contempt and risk arrest and/or violence (possibly even death); meanwhile, a "better" who reciprocated would be disowned and possibly shut off in a nunnery, a monastery—or even an asylum. Hence all those tragic servant/slave/peasant loves the lord/lady/king/queen, and their Love Ruins the Realm ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRuinsTheRealm"] stories. The accepted practice for someone in love with a royal, at least in contemporary fiction, was to express that love through loyalty and duty rather than presume to have a romantic relationship with them. Forbidden Love ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenLove"] and its sub-tropes are often the reason two lovers are star-crossed. May be used as a Pretext for War. One of the top reasons for a Balcony Wooing Scene. Contrast Love Transcends Spacetime ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTranscendsSpacetime"] and Nobody Thinks It Will Work, where the power of love overcomes.</hero:tropeDescription>
