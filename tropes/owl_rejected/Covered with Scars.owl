    <hero:tropeDescription>A character's entire body is covered in hundreds of scars. This trope is used to show that the character is a badass, a veteran, or a Broken Bird ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird"] who lived through a lot of fights or suffered a great deal of pain and torture. Often times these scars will be linked to mental scars related to how they gained them. If the scars are self-inflicted, expect the character to be more than a little off ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy"]. Subtrope of Rugged Scar ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuggedScar"]. Related to Dented Iron, Good Scars, Evil Scars, Every Scar Has a Story, and Scars are Forever. May involve a Scar Survey. See also Frozen Face.</hero:tropeDescription>
