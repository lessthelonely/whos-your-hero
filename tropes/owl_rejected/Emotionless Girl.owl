    <hero:tropeDescription>A common response to the stereotype of women as overly emotional ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HystericalWoman"], the Emotionless Girl is an enigmatic female character who appears to be entirely emotionless. Whether she actually is emotionless depends on the story and often on her level of characterization. As seen in the page quote, it's common for one of these characters to have had to hide any signs of emotionality ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheMask"], often for fear of being disregarded and written off as a Hysterical Woman. Sometimes, however, she is simply The Spock or, in villainous examples, The Sociopath. This can also be Played for Laughs since characters of this archetype are typically male. It is important to note that this is not simply a girl or woman who does not conform to the typically higher standard of emotional intelligence for females ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard"]. This character goes beyond healthy management of emotion and enters a disturbing, perhaps even creepy realm of emotional numbness. Be on the lookout for another character making an "is she even human?" comment. As emotions are a major part of social interaction, the emotionless girl is usually depicted as having No Social Skills ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills"], which often leads to her being isolated or even ostracized. Even when not physically isolated, she is very likely to be Alone in a Crowd, aloof from the rest of the group. The rare Emotionless Girl who can handle social interaction is usually depicted as a cool manipulator who, while unable to empathize in a normal manner, has learned through experience how to handle people. If she's a teenager, there's a high likelihood that she's either a Goth ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth"], a Creepy Loner Girl, or both. This is a female-specific ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale"] subtrope of The Stoic. Sister-trope to Ice Queen and Defrosting Ice Queen. Often overlaps with The Hermit, The Quiet One, Robot Girl, The Cynic, or Tin Man. In comedies, tends to partake in either The Comically Serious or Deadpan Snarking. Quite often a Foil to a more Hot-Blooded partner to form a Red Oni, Blue Oni or Straight Man and Wise Guy pair. Contrast Sugar-and-Ice Personality, where the character is alternatingly warm and aloof.</hero:tropeDescription>
