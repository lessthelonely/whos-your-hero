    <hero:tropeDescription>In Super Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero"] Comic Books, the Status Quo Is God. It might not seem like that at first, what with all the deaths, resurrections, Face Heel Turns, Heel Face Turns, and whatnot. It's a rare year — honestly, a rare month — where comic book readers aren't gravely informed that Nothing Is the Same Anymore. Yet, take a look at the major characters of The DCU ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU"] or the Marvel Universe today and five or ten years ago. Things will be different, but not that different, and most of the major changes will seem to have happened recently. The companies that own these characters, like all large corporations, are conservative (in this case meaning wanting to maintain a status quo), and all these dramatic changes have a noticeable tendency to cancel out in the long run. Once a character establishes an iconic status quo, or becomes part of another character's iconic status quo, it can be extremely difficult to change anything major about that character. There is, however, one category of change that's an interesting exception: the "graduation" of Sidekicks ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick"] to become independent heroes in their own right, or assume their mentor's mantle (which can overlap with Passing the Torch). Perhaps it is only because this tends to be accompanied by finally aging the character from a teen to an adult, and even in the Retcon-happy world of comics, reversing that without breaking the Willing Suspension of Disbelief is hard (with the possible exception being large-scale Reboots, since everything for the most part is turned back to square 1). Still, it also seems that negative fan reaction to these changes is also much, much rarer than with the average change. What little of it there is tends to occur when another character's mantle is taken by the graduating sidekick ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter"], with fans of that character being understandably upset at the displacement, rather than desire to see the sidekick remain a sidekick. When that sort of thing happens, it's most often remedied by simply having the character graduate again, creating their own hero identity and handing the Legacy Character baton back to its proper holder. The real life version is probably soldiers, politicians, artists or sportsmen initially apprenticing under experienced mentors ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor"] who may or may not be big names before proving their worth and becoming equally famous in their own right.
