    <hero:tropeDescription>'90s Anti-Heroes are the polar opposites of your typical Silver Age ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks"] superheroes. Not only are they flawed, they may lack any heroic attributes, apart from the fact that they never lose. They appeal to the audience strictly due to being totally committed to... whatever the hell they're doing at the moment. They have no compunction about killing criminals and, indeed, this may extend to anyone who gets in their way; when confronted by classic archetypes, such as The Cape, they dismiss them as dupes and fools. To aid in this murderous work, '90s Anti-Heroes with superpowers tend to have superpowers of the directly lethal variety, usually these abilities are demonic or technological in origin, and never received through the idealistic good graces of anyone. The '90s Anti-Heroes who lack supernatural abilities usually make up for it by carrying guns. Lots of guns. Male N.A.H.s are easy to identify: ridiculously muscled, and often wear lots of pouches ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooManyBelts"] or bandoliers. There's a good chance he's either middle aged with lots of long, grey hair and beard stubble, or scars, but either way, he's likely to be masculinity incarnate. He also probably has at least one eye that looks fake, injured, or diseased and he carries a ludicrously oversized gun or sword which no mortal could possibly carry. Female Nineties Anti-Heroes, like most ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostCommonSuperpower"] female superheroes, have large breasts and small waists, but unlike most ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostCommonSuperpower"] female superheroes, this is often taken to disfiguring extremes. They don't tend to wear very much clothing (or if they do, it'll be typical superheroic barely-there "spandex" which showcases their exaggerated/inaccurate anatomy). But they still usually wear tights in some form. The ultimate extreme of the female version was the "Bad Girl Comic" subgenre, featuring ludicrously buxom, near-naked Dark Action Girls, generally with some kind of supernatural nature or origin, hacking and pouting their way through plots designed solely to offer as much Gorn and Fanservice as possible. Usually, they'll have gritty names at most two words long ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAgeOfSupernames"] that wouldn't be out of place on villains, often creatively misspelled*  'Shade' becomes 'Shayde', etc to appear more dramatic, because poor literacy is kewl, to make the character look radical, or to make them easier to trademark. In terms of characterization, they have one thing in common above all else. '90s Anti-Heroes are willing, if not outright eager, to use extremely violent methods and intimidation to solve their problems. As such, emotions are limited to further this goal: brooding ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst"], sarcastic, cynical, or just plain psycho are all common traits of the '90s Anti-Hero. The one thing that keeps them out of villain status is typically because they're the story's Designated Heroes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero"], and the stories they are in typically falls far on the cynical side of the Sliding Scale. In a world with Black-and-Gray Morality, the heroes may earn their "hero" status simply by fighting villains who are even worse. Note that, in spite of the cynical-sounding write-up, this is not a bad trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools"]. It's just that, as with most Darker and Edgier fiction, it's very difficult to describe without making the whole premise sound inherently ridiculous.note This can make sorting out the parodies a little tricky. Something of a Discredited Trope these days, as most of the original comic anti-heroes have been Retooled or Put on a Bus; more often you see parodies of this kind of character, Deadpool being among the most famous, but they still come up occasionally in Video Games. As for why the '90s produced so many of this type of Antihero, Check out the Analysis Page. If one of these is replacing an older more optimistic hero, you have an example of an Anti-Hero Substitute ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHeroSubstitute"]. It's also one of the stages of the superhero Reconstruction. Commonly paired with Superhero Packing Heat ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroPackingHeat"]. See also: Sociopathic Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero"], Action Genre Hero Guy, Designated Hero and Byronic Hero. Should not be confused with the Heroic Comedic Sociopath, who is blatantly evil and Played for Laughs. Generally, '90s Anti-Heroes tend to range from Unscrupulous Heroes to Nominal Heroes, though some can be Villain Protagonists. Many Magical Girl Genre Deconstruction works are to Magical Girls in the 2010s what these were to superheroes in the 1990s.</hero:tropeDescription>
