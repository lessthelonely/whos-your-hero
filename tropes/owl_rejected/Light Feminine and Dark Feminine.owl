    <hero:tropeDescription>This is a character contrast trope. Both female characters are decidedly feminine but in different ways. The light is generally angelic and feels love, whereas the dark is generally devilish and plays with desire. The light is usually sweet and naïve, whereas the dark is usually aloof and brooding. Either type applies to a Tomboy and Girly Girl ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyAndGirlyGirl"] contrast. May overlap with Hair-Contrast Duo when their hair color is used to denote their light-and-dark femininity. When a love interest is involved, it's likely to lead to a Betty and Veronica love triangle: Betty being the Light Feminine, and Veronica being the Dark Feminine. As with any two-character trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuoTropes"], the two characters have to have some sort of relationship with each other, be it friends, family, love interests, or rivals for a love interest, so the two characters can be playing the traits directly off each other. The dark feminine character is not always a villain or a whore ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadonnaWhoreComplex"], or even necessarily half of a "good girl, bad girl" or "naughty and nice" pair. It could be that she's just the more serious, sophisticated, or mature half of the pair. In some cases, she's even as sweet and innocent as her Light counterpart but finds herself drawn to the shadows. Remember, Dark Is Not Evil. Likewise, Light Is Not Good and the Light Feminine need not be either The Ingenue or The Pollyanna but may be distinguished by her nobleness, proactiveness, or determination. Compare the innocent child and the seductress of The Three Faces of Eve ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThreeFacesOfEve"] as well as the sweet-naïve one and sexy one of the Four-Girl Ensemble. With a duo consisting of a Magical Girl and a Dark Magical Girl, in general, the Magical Girl is Light Feminine and the Dark Magical Girl is Dark Feminine. The Spear Counterpart ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearCounterpart"] is Noble Male, Roguish Male — two guys who are both masculine but in different ways. In modern Western culture, "feminine" usually implies Light Feminine, while "masculine" usually implies Roguish Male ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemaleAngelMaleDemon"]. When Dark Feminine and Noble Male are paired up, you usually get Masculine Girl, Feminine Boy. Not to be confused with Pale Females, Dark Males ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaleFemalesDarkMales"]. This is about personality, not fur/skin color.</hero:tropeDescription>
