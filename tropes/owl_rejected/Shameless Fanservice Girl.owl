    <hero:tropeDescription>A character (usually female) is not embarrassed by their state of undress. The "other half" of the Innocent Fanservice Girl ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentFanserviceGirl"]. The key difference between the two is that while the Innocent Fanservice Girl's lack of a nudity taboo is based on the fact that she never knew of its existence (i.e., she's too innocent to know better), the Shameless Fanservice Girl does know, but just doesn't care. She ignores nudity taboos by choice and couldn't care less who's disturbed by it. This is not "the exhibitionism trope" either, but rather "the knowingly unashamed trope". Exhibitionists expose themselves to others for their own self-gratification. In contrast, and akin to the Innocent Fanservice Girl, no matter how other characters and the audience may see it, she just doesn't see it as kinky. This doesn't necessarily mean she prances around the streets in the nude constantly. Perhaps she's just the type who Sleeps in the Nude ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepsInTheNude"], spends all of her private time in her house either without clothing or in just her underwear, or only goes nude when she feels safe doing so, such as at the beach. Perhaps she simply got into a situation where she ends up in a state of undress, but simply does not care enough about modesty for it to affect her. But whatever the reasoning and specifics, the key factor is that she does understand that her state of undress is typically frowned upon by people. Her amount of consideration for people who are uncomfortable around her nudity can vary. Sometimes she will get dressed just for the sake of her audience. Other times she'll have a "screw you" attitude and not let the disturbed countenance ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleasePutSomeClothesOn"] of her audience persuade her to stop being naked if she wants to be, sometimes she will act like The Tease or The Gadfly and enjoy the reactions she gets. It pretty much depends on what kind of person she is. Satirical or comedic versions frequently have her facing no repercussions at all (much like her innocent sister-trope), or only comedic ones. Sometimes, for extra comedic effect, her nudity will only be noticed by one person whilst being ignored by everyone else for no apparent reason ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight"]. More serious portrayals will tend towards the discreet: Characters that reject the taboo but otherwise do not make it an issue, or only in semi-private situations where they are within their rights to decide what to wear. While this trope can overlap with Attention Whores ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore"], it is not a subtrope. This does not preclude a rare Attention Whore who is also a Shameless Fanservice Girl, but it is not a requirement. The polar opposite of Reluctant Fanservice Girl ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantFanserviceGirl"], who is definitely embarrassed and bothered by it.</hero:tropeDescription>
