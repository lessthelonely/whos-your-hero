    <hero:tropeDescription>A Breakout Character ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter"] is the most popular or well known part of their franchise. However, what most don't realize is that this character did not appear until an installment or two in, having been completely absent at the franchise's beginning. Yet the character has become so iconic the lack of their presence feels like Early-Installment Weirdness. Possible causes of this include adaptations frequently condensing the original story and including characters earlier on than the original (especially when the original undergoes Adaptation Displacement ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement"]) or the franchise not Growing the Beard and gaining a larger audience until after the Iconic Sequel Character makes their debut, or the first installment isn't that well known. Compare Second Episode Introduction ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondEpisodeIntroduction"], which is this on a much smaller scale, and Ascended Extra, for when the character is there the whole time, just in a greatly reduced role. Contrast Demoted to Extra ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra"] for when a character has importance in the beginning of a work, but their role decreases as the work goes on. Subtrope of Newer Than They Think. Related to Iconic Sequel Song ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicSequelSong"], when a piece of music, rather than a character, rises to become iconic despite originating in a later work. Note: in order for a character in a serialized series to count, they must have appeared no earlier than the second season. Characters who appeared late in the first season go under Breakout Character ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter"]. Also note: not every significant character who debuted after a franchise's first installment is this trope. Try to keep the "Iconic" part in mind when considering adding an example.
