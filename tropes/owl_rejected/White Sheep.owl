    <hero:tropeDescription>Everyone is familiar with the teenager "going through a phase" or being an out-and-out rebel. Little can equal the shame to a family with a legacy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter"] of heroism of a prodigal son or daughter who turns to villainy. Except, there are just as many families with a legacy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter"] of evil, so what exactly is a teen rebel supposed to do to rebel against people who are already rebelling? Why, rebel against evil and make a Heelâ€“Face Turn ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn"]! Much like a Phlebotinum Rebel ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumRebel"], Defector from Decadence, and not-strictly-political Cultural Rebel, the White Sheep rebels against their family's values by taking on "traditional" rebellious attitudes. Sometimes, one of two variations are seen: first, is when the character actually struggles to fit in with the evil family and feels bad that they don't. Alternatively, the "Sheep" is still fairly evil, but they rebel by acting like a normal person. Naturally, some White Sheep may "grow out of the phase" and fully embrace their evil roots. Other times, they might discover that Good Feels Good ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood"] (or that Being Evil Sucks) and make the change permanent. The parents of such a rebellious child may try to "correct" the problem by enrolling them in an Academy of Evil. Contrast supertrope Black Sheep ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep"], for all other reasons a family member may be isolated from the family. See also Anti Anti Christ ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAntiChrist"], and Only Sane Man; depending on how idealistic the work is, a White Sheep can be the latter. Compare Evil Parents Want Good Kids and Rebellious Rebel. If the evil family show up after the White Sheep has built healthy relationships with good people, they're dealing with the fact that Friends Are Chosen, Family Aren't. If your rebellion is against your entire species, see My Species Doth Protest Too Much.
