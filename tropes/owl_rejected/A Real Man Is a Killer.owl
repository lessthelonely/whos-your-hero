    <hero:tropeDescription>How many roads must a man walk down before you can call him a man? ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan"] The world may never know, but one thing is for sure; at the end of one of those roads, he had better kill somebody. The tradition of killing as an initiation into manhood is at least as old as ancient Sparta, making this trope both Older Than Feudalism ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism"] and based in reality, not fiction. A fundamental tenant of the hunter-gatherer social order, but largely irrelevant today as a means of testing the mettle of a new member of the hunting troupe. Still, that doesn't stop many buttoned-down, work-a-day suburban fathers fearing their son will go astray if he doesn't go through this rite of passage (which his own ancestors may or may not have had to undergo themselves, at least in TV land). Every once in a while, either because the society/organization is gender-blind or because someone wants to get in on the deadly fun, a woman will go through the same process, to mixed reactions... or no reaction at all if it were one of those aforementioned gender-blind societies/organizations. A variation of this trope is for elite military forces to kill a man (an enemy or even a low ranking ally) as part of their initiation. Outside of the distant past, the twilight years of the Imperial Japanese Army ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan"], or a handful of the small and isolated tribes from over half a century ago, this is also largely a Discredited Trope today (except perhaps in cases where said troop is depicted as villainous, thereby avoiding Truth in Television considerations). A spin on the military angle involves spies who, in order to become full-fledged agents, are required to undergo "a final test"; this generally involves cold-bloodedly killing a target, possibly even one trying to surrender. Examples include James Bond (who per Casino Royale (2006) and the original novels needed to assassinate two people before attaining 00 status) and the 2010s versions of Nikita and Chuck, both of which included plotlines requiring lead characters to kill in order to advance. Today, this trope comes with Unfortunate Implications ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications"], particularly in Real Life: If such a rite of passage was justified back in ancient times and still is in some contexts, it has now been Flanderized into a much less noble pursuit. It contends that reveling in violence or deriving pleasure from killing something/someone is the epitome of manhood and the definition of badassery. In fact, these days you are much more likely to see this trope inverted: A man is expected to kill in order to prove something, and his refusal to do so is what proves his moral integrity (in some cases, this could even provide him with an Androcles' Lion protector). It's only in places where there are legitimate targets for murder that we see anything like the original spin. Zombies, aliens, or other inhuman enemies? No worries, people will be expected to prove they are worth having along by mercilessly killing them. Other people, even bad people, not so much, though it still happens. Even in modern examples that play it straight, there is still a tendency in grittier works to expect the men, even those like doctors or confirmed pacifists, to join in on the aforementioned justified killing. If they do it's often treated as a moment of them outgrowing their cowardice, while such standards are not applied to the physically capable women of the group. Even in military contexts, this has become a Discredited Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope"]. Modern psychological research implies that sane/normal men have very strong aversions to killing another human being. The studies of General S.L.A. Marshall showed that only 15% of frontline soldiers ever fired their rifles in combat, and only 2% aimed to kill. Lieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman has done research on killing in action, and he states that a sane and psychologically normal man must be especially conditioned for him to be able to shoot at the enemy, and most of the killing in action is done by indirect fire, machine guns, and exceptional individuals (i.e. psychopaths and "natural soldiers"). Unfortunately, this conditioning is also the Trope Maker for These Hands Have Killed. Truth in Television, especially amongst Vietnam War veterans, who have experienced post-traumatic stress disorder in frequencies far exceeding those of the World War II veterans. The concept of "blooded" versus "green" forces (a continuum, not either/or) is different: killing (or dying) is not required, but you must have remained and functioned with your unit for some time in combat before you start to be regarded as trustworthy. Contrast Real Women Don't Wear Dresses ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealWomenDontWearDresses"] and Badass Pacifist. Sometimes used in training The Spartan Way (not to be confused with literal Spartan training, which also required this).
