    <hero:tropeDescription>This trope takes place when one character is thrown into the shoes of a dead man to experience his final moments. Either the player reads a pamphlet about Timmy's brutal slaying by a monster which then comes to try to kill the player, or he has to complete a dead man's task, witnessing and experiencing what killed the person before him. Related to Apocalyptic Log ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog"] and Mook Horror Show. Compare Psychic Glimpse of Death, where the terror is happening in the present moment.</hero:tropeDescription>
