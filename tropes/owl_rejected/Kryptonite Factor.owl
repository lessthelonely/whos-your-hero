    <hero:tropeDescription>The Kryptonite Factor is an Achilles' Heel ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel"] where the weakness is something that affects the Superhero and typically just them, as it will have little to no effect on others. It typically comes as a rare material, specific mental hang-up or abstract limitation in their abilities, any of which can be a Power Nullifier. Fundamentally this is to show that no one is invulnerable, not even our godlike main character. This is especially ironic if the vulnerability is completely arbitrary and oddly commonplace. The more powerful a character is, the more likely the Kryptonite Factor will be abused. Writers in particular tend to dislike immensely powerful characters with a single Kryptonite Factor, because not using it creates a drama-destroying ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaPreservingHandicap"] sense that the character is never under a serious threat. Conversely, if Kryptonite was supposed to be rare it strains credibility when it starts showing up everywhere. This comes as a contrast to Logical Weakness ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness"], wherein the Achilles' Heel comes about more naturally through understanding the real-world nature of their abilities (ie water-based powers are vulnerable to electricity-based powers) or being consistent with the fictional depiction of how their powers work. The name comes from kryptonite, the bane of Superman ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman"] regardless of how powerful he is being portrayed at the time. A literal green rock, it seemed unusually abundant in supervillainous hands for being radioactive bits of a planet that exploded lightyears away. Many Elseworlds and spin offs to the Superman ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman"] mythos include characters who are more resistant to kryptonite, but conveniently, not as strong. Thanks to Superman ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman"] being a Long Runner, and Pop-Cultural Osmosis, a common bit of Memetic Mutation is to refer to something you are particularly vulnerable to as "My Kryptonite". Compare Supernatural Repellent ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalRepellent"], which is not specific to superheroes. See also Kryptonite Ring, Kryptonite-Proof Suit and Fight Off the Kryptonite. Contrast De-power, Cross-Melting Aura and Drama-Preserving Handicap. Related to Why Did It Have to Be Snakes?. If the character is vulnerable to something comparatively mundane (and even non-threatening), that makes it a Weaksauce Weakness. When this trope turns up far more often than seems probable, see Kryptonite Is Everywhere. When this extends to having characters whose powers are nothing more than a Kryptonite Factor, you have a Man of Kryptonite. Not to be confused with The Krypton Factor ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKryptonFactor"]. By the Power of Grayskull! is more or less the opposite, giving powers as opposed to taking them away.</hero:tropeDescription>
