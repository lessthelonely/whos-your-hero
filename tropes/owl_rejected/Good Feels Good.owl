    <hero:tropeDescription>As self-evident as it sounds ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself"], Good Feels Good. The Hero says Keep the Reward because they have already received their reward; the knowledge that they have done good. Even if no one will know and no one will thank them, they will know and that's enough. This trait is common in the Ideal Hero, The Cape, and other archetypes. Where the interesting part comes in is that bad guys are quick to find out not only that Evil Feels Good ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFeelsGood"] when using The Dark Side, but doing good deeds in accordance with the God of Good can be just as if not more pleasurable, albeit in different ways. The Mole ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole"] may end up Becoming the Mask from the cheering crowds, the feeling inside that they are loved, and have made one or more others safe (and not having to worry about jail time!). Good can be headier than any evil banquet or wine, and won't leave a horrible aftertaste. The genuine love and admiration from the masses can seem a far more potent rush than what they once felt from their screams of panic and pleas of mercy. The Power of Friendship itself can make a normally evil aligned character question or outright change their allegiances and alignment when they know their boss cares less for them than their black cape, while their new friends will risk life and limb for them. Usually results in a Heelâ€“Face Turn, and if part of an evil team, a falling out / civil war. Such defection may come easier if the character in question is a Token Good Teammate. May lead to a Redemption Demotion ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionDemotion"] because Good Is Dumb, and while good feels good, its selling point is not predicated on giving out power. No less often, the bad guy will "resist" the temptation of good, or find they can't quit the Psycho Serum, much to their own dismay. They might also lose their Friend in the Black Market, otherwise they risk either slipping into old habits or having something get taken out of context, among other issues. May also lead to a Redemption Promotion ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionPromotion"] because Good Is Not Dumb; Power of Trust facilitates teamwork and The Power of Friendship aids motivation. Turning good may also allow them to use Holy Hand Grenades or some other such 'good' abilities that were inaccessible when they were evil. They might also gain a Friend on the Force since now they're working on the same team (but maybe not right away). It can be the litmus test for a video game's writing in particular. If the "good guys" inspire Video Game Cruelty Potential ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential"], something has Gone Horribly Wrong. See Pet the Dog ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog"], for when a villain does something nice and does seem to like doing it, but doesn't (usually) make a habit out of it. Compare Smiting Evil Feels Good ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmitingEvilFeelsGood"], For Happiness, Rightly Self-Righteous, and Sexual Karma.
