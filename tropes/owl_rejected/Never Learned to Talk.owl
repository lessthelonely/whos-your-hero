    <hero:tropeDescription>Often the case for a Cute Mute ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMute"]. Sometimes a silent character may learn to speak quite suddenly. If the character does not know how to speak as a result of being deaf, expect them to use sign language. This character might double as The Unintelligible if they only communicate with certain sounds. In some cases, the character understands speech just fine, and just has trouble reproducing it. Someone who doesn't speak because they are physically incapable of speech is The Speechless ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpeechless"]; someone who chooses not to speak is Elective Mute; someone who is implied to speak but never does so onscreen is The Voiceless. Note that this is in-universe; if the work is about Nearly Normal Animals ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearlyNormalAnimal"] who can talk to each other, and one of the animal characters can't even talk to other animals (e.g Ed the Hyena from The Lion King), then it's not this trope. If animals hear a human character speaking a human language but humans hear the character making animal noises, it is this trope. Not to be confused with Dumb Struck ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbStruck"], which is when characters are unable to speak due to trauma they've suffered.</hero:tropeDescription>
