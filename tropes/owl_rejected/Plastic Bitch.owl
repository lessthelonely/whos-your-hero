    <hero:tropeDescription>In fiction, the people most likely to get plastic surgery or other kinds of cosmetic procedures are unpleasant (and probably rich). Maybe they mention a boob job in a throwaway line, regularly get Botox or lip fillers, or spend a whole episode getting a nose job. Regardless of the exact procedure, this instantly characterizes the character as vain and appearance-obsessed. Having the money to spend on cosmetic procedures is an easy way to show a character is a Rich Bitch ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch"]. In addition, this could be used to show that these characters have insecurities about their appearance for all their haughtiness. Because Vanity Is Feminine ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanityIsFeminine"], this trope is mainly used for women or dandyish men. In a High School setting, the Alpha Bitch might mention getting plastic surgery, and her 'artificial' beauty will contrast the 'natural' beauty of the Girl Next Door and the Cool Loser. The same can be said for the Obnoxious Entitled Housewife in a neighborhood setting. In real life, people get plastic surgery for a variety of non-vanity reasons, such as recovering from accidents. Attitudes towards plastic surgery vary across cultures; in South Korea, for example, it is relatively common. Will often overlap with Fake Boobs ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBoobs"], and Breast Expansion, as breast augmentation is a common cosmetic surgery in a setting with Buxom Beauty Standard. Examples of underage girls may fall into Troubling Unchildlike Behavior if they are trying to be Younger Than They Look. Compare Just the Way You Are ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheWayYouAre"], where someone decides against getting cosmetic surgery and embraces their natural appearance, Makeup Is Evil, where makeup (a temporary way to enhance one's appearance) is also associated with vanity and villains, and Vain Sorceress, a villainess who uses magic, not cosmetic surgery, to remain youthful and beautiful, and Looks Worth Killing For. See also Magic Plastic Surgery ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPlasticSurgery"] and Surgical Impersonation, which turn you into a whole new person.</hero:tropeDescription>
