    <hero:tropeDescription>An artificial or even biological being designed specifically for warfare suddenly decides that they aren't satisfied with their current career. Maybe they've developed sentience ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAIJustAddWater"], maybe an innocent bystander managed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, maybe they've just learned that The Men in Black who made them don't exactly have the best interests of the public in mind. Regardless, they've decided to turn in their guns and try life off the battlefield. Naturally, this newfound aversion to violence rarely goes over well with the construct's creators, who will almost always go out of their way to regain control. Old enemies of said weapon's "employers" will invariably be very interested to note that such a powerful force has suddenly become up for grabs. Let's not even get into the endless number of other sides that will get involved. Whatever the case may be, sufferers of this trope can pretty much write off any hope of a normal life ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal"] (if they were human-looking enough to qualify for such) and expect a very hectic time dealing with at least three different sides all attempting to control, destroy, and/or befriend them at once. Expect a lot of justifiable angst from one of these guys as they desperately try (and fail) to stay out of situations where they have to use their Swiss Army Weapons and convince people that they really don't want to murder them all after one slip up with the built-in flamethrowers. It becomes even harder if they're named after the weapon they wield/are. Common "victims": Tyke-Bomb ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb"], Phlebotinum Rebel, Sympathetic Sentient Weapon, Secret Project Refugee Family, Person of Mass Destruction. Super-Trope of Defusing the Tyke-Bomb ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb"]. Compare Anti-Anti-Christ. Contrast Three Laws-Compliant.</hero:tropeDescription>
