    <hero:tropeDescription>The Amazonian Beauty is what happens when Ms. Fanservice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice"] hulks out. Often times, such as in fighting video games like Street Fighter ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter"], a lot of beautiful women are jacked but no one comments on it, since to the characters it is the norm for them to see characters like that, despite the fact that they are still Ms Fanservices who go above and beyond the call of duty in some cases. A quick litmus test for this trope is: If the answer to all four above is "yes," the character qualifies for this trope. This female character can take her muscularity to Heroic Build ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild"] levels. Sometimes starts out as a Super-Strong Child, and usually (if not almost always) is an Action Girl. They always have large breasts, strong toned muscles, toned midriffs, sculpted abs, toned broad shoulders, and strong well-developed legs. An Amazonian Beauty will sometimes spend all her time in her battle gear in order to lead into a She Cleans Up Nicely moment when the plot requires stuffing her into more feminine attire like a ballgown or a wedding dress, both of which invariably end in Kicking Ass in All Her Finery. Compare Amazon Chaser ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonChaser"] where a character finds a woman attractive because of her fighting skills. If he's attracted to her muscles, she's an Amazonian Beauty. Of course, both tropes can be in play at the same time if he's attracted to both. Given that these girls are often tall to further enhance their presentation of strength, romances with them are likely to result in Tiny Guy, Huge Girl and Masculine Girl, Feminine Boy. Contrasts with No Guy Wants an Amazon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGuyWantsAnAmazon"], Brawn Hilda and Big Beautiful Woman. Some of these characters also double as Statuesque Stunners. Often times giant women will be this type of beauty, especially if they are from a tribe of giants. When the female in question worries about the slippery slope between this trope and Brawn Hilda, it usually results in Muscle Angst. Her smaller (and equally dangerous) sister or cousin is the Cute Bruiser. For the Amazonian Beauty's Spear Counterpart, see Hunk. Doesn't necessarily have to be ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant"] women from the Amazon Rainforest.</hero:tropeDescription>
