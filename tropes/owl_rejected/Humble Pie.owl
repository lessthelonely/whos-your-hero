    <hero:tropeDescription>Sometimes, just to rub it in some more, it can be followed by a Humiliation Conga ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga"] and might result in Breaking The Haughty. In more obvious cases, the character will actually be called out for his arrogant attitude, but usually the situation is more subtle and the realization is more personal. There are many ways for a character to respond. Oftentimes the character will simply accept their failure, realize the error of their ways, and change themselves ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn"] to become a genuinely more tolerable person. Other characters simply cannot handle eating Humble Pie and may react with anything from a Villainous Breakdown to something much more drastic. The trope name comes from the phrase "to eat humble pie," meaning for someone to be humiliated. The phrase is derived from umble pie, which was a food made of offal (that is, the internal organs and other "throw-away" parts unwanted by the wealthy) during the Medieval, Early Modern, and Modern Periods (basically until the 1960s-70s in Anglophone culture) that was the often only form of non-seafood meat eaten by the lower-middle classes unless they happened to own any livestock. Similar dishes included oysters, lobsters, and salmon which were likewise regarded as dishes for the poor because of the animals' commonness (and thus cheapness) and their meats' strong taste. A similar phrase is "eating crow", a bird known for being particularly unpalatable. Compare with Humiliation Conga ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga"], which is what happens when a character is forced to eat several Humble Pies all at once, and Break the Haughty, which is basically this trope on steroids in regards to the event(s) the fallout from them. No relation to Humble Pie, the band led by The Small Faces ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmallFaces"] singer Steve Marriott and Peter Frampton.</hero:tropeDescription>
