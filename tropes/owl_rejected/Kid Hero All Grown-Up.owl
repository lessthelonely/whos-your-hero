Kid Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero"] All Grown Up is a common play on the Kid Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero"] trope, showing what happens to our hero many years later. This trope can be a permanent change, by having a Kid Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero"] grow up in the story, or a temporary look into the future. It can also be used as backstory by introducing an adult character and then revealing that they used to be a Kid Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero"]. Some common outcomes are: This is also common as a Back Story ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory"] for the hero's mentor or parent. If the villain is revealed to be a former Kid Hero, they may also fall under Used to Be a Sweet Kid, Fallen Hero, or A Pupil of Mine Until He Turned to Evil.
