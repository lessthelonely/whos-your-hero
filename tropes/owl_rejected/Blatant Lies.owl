    <hero:tropeDescription>No, we're not going to Describe Blatant Lies because... ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/DescribeTopicHere"] This page is blank! There's nothing to see! Definitely nothing, especially a page describing blatant lies! Goodbye! So one of the characters has a secret, one that they do not want leaking out. Unfortunately, Clark Kenting ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting"] doesn't always cut it, and some aspect of the secret is going to be glaringly obvious no matter what. So they have to come up with an excuse for their situation, and tell a lie. Similar to A Wizard Did It ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt"], but instead of hand-waving some implausible aspect of the series, the character is the one doing the hand-waving to another character. In the ideal version of the trope, most people accept this because of their built-in Weirdness Censor ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor"], or because it's executed as a Seamless Spontaneous Lie. When it fails, you get That Liar Lies followed by Implausible Deniability. May or may not involve hesitation. Will almost inevitably accompany any Paper-Thin Disguise or Most Definitely Not a Villain. Often delivered by a Bad Liar. Suspiciously Specific Denial is a subtrope. See also Metaphorically True and Insistent Terminology. Some statements that are true "from a certain point of view ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue"]" may be blatant lies. A "Blind Idiot" Translation can also turn something that SHOULD be true into a blatant lie or vice versa. In Real Life ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife"], this is the most offensive form of turd polish. But Real Life ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife"] examples are welcome anyways. We swear, trust me! To be confused with ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/NotToBeConfusedWith"] Sarcasm Mode. Do not contrast with I Lied, which is when a character outright lies, but the lying is not blatant. Refuge in Audacity covers the cases when this ploy actually works. Obviously Not Fine is a subtrope. Compare Confession Deferred, in which the truth is uncovered after lies. Also see Photo Identification Denial, especially when someone denies knowing a person after being shown their photograph, but it's clear they're lying.</hero:tropeDescription>
