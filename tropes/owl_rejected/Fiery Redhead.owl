    <hero:tropeDescription>A Fiery Redhead is a red-haired character who is strong, Hot-Blooded ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded"], outgoing, usually outspoken, and (if a love interest) often female. She has a big personality and she's not afraid to use it. Whatever you do, don't get on her bad side, or there will be hell to pay. (Especially if powers of personality and/or elements are present: she likes Playing with Fire. Thus, in a Four-Temperament Ensemble, expect her to be Choleric.) She will be unladylike unless it's the case of a redheaded Spirited Young Lady. She might be One of the Boys, a tomboy or a lad-ette. Heroes do like redheads after all. This hair-color stereotype probably developed since red hair was associated with the Irish and Scottish ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScotIreland"] (and before this, Horny Vikings) for a long time, and they ended up being stereotyped as loud, strong, and passionate (see the Fighting Irish and Violent Glaswegian tropes for more info on that). On the other hand, it's even found in Eastern Europe where any association would have been with Russians or Swedes, and these are nationalities not generally stereotyped as hotheaded. In addition to this, it extends even into ancient texts from Babylonian and Scandinavian Oral Historian. In the Prose Edda ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProseEdda"], Odin is depicted as blond, green-eyed, cool, and calculating — while his son, Thor, is a redheaded, blue-eyed (something of an omen of war/perfection in Scandinavian culture) fire-breathing stereotypical Viking (the raiding kind) who treats Earth as a giant freshman mixer. Gilgamesh is also a Fiery Redhead with blue eyes whose duties include being a good precursor to Thor, for the most part — though with more reservation and a cooling trend near the end of his life (this makes both an eerie paradigm of Fiery Redheads at the creation of their respective people's writings). The whole "red-haired, blue-eyed" thing is usually split in Japan between two people. Although real redheads ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"] can have tempers like about anyone else, this trait is exaggerated in fiction, so no real life examples are listed here. Also, they can have green eyes and this association is also exaggerated in fiction. Compare Heroes Want Redheads ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesWantRedheads"], Evil Redhead, Rose-Haired Sweetie, Red-Headed Stepchild, Redheads Are Uncool, Red Is Heroic. In anime, could be a Tsundere. If you have a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead in close proximity (i.e. in the main cast), it's Blonde, Brunette, Redhead. Contrast Shy Blue-Haired Girl for Red Oni, Blue Oni and Eerie Pale-Skinned Brunette for the realistic opposite hair color and personality. Compare and contrast Beware the Nice Ones; if the two overlap, you get a redheaded character who is super nice and calm all the time but briefly becomes this trope once pushed too far. Please do not confuse this with ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant"] a redhead being literally fiery, or having literal fiery head, although these tropes may overlap. And a red who's literally fiery does have their hair color fit their elemental powers. See also Red Is Violent (in this case, the hair color). </hero:tropeDescription>
