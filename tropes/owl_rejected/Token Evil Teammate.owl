    <hero:tropeDescription>Just because the main characters are fighting to oust the Big Bad ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad"] doesn't mean they're heroes... at least, not all of them. In a team composed of good members, there will often be one Token Evil Teammate. Narratively, this character can serve as a distinct and amoral foil ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil"] to his more strait-laced colleagues. If the Heroes start putting Honor Before Reason, the Token Evil will often remind them that sometimes unpleasant methods are needed to save the world. They also provide Your Approval Fills Me with Shame for when the heroes are getting too pragmatic and forget their morals. These characters are often Played for Laughs ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs"] as the Heroic Comedic Sociopath. A lot of the humor they provide is of the Crosses the Line Twice variety, doing obscenely wrong things because it's shocking and unexpected, as well as a form of escapism. On the other side of the fence, a very serious character that fills this role might see it as Dirty Business, and do what they have to on behalf of The Team. Despite the name, the Token Evil Teammate has a lot of leeway as to his Character Alignment ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment"]. There are many kinds of (the meaner) Anti-Heroes, Anti-Villains and yes, outright villains who can fill this role. Regardless of character type, the mainstays of this role are usually: snarkiness, jerkiness, violence, and a tendency to become the Butt-Monkey for their behavior. It should also be mentioned that "treachery" was not on that list. The thing with the Token Evil Teammate is that evil does not mean incapable of friendship. While they are usually out for themselves first, they will often have reasons to stay loyal to their team as a whole, or at least individual members. Sometimes they'll (very ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds"]) begrudgingly admit that they like their teammates, or at least find them less intolerable than they say, and frequently they find their association either lucrative, entertaining, or even enjoyable. If it's pointed out by somebody that they're not as bad as they make themselves out to be though, they'll generally tell them to shut up, or to take it back. For extra points, this can be done in either a very ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds"] cold, aloof or very ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds"] rude and loud way. If they do betray their teammates, expect The Captain ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain"] to tighten the Morality Chain or Restraining Bolt and use various threats like Death Glares to bring them back in line. Why don't they kill him or at least kick him out? Because sometimes you just need the firepower, and they can "do more good than malice" (or at least less harm) on the good guys' side than dead or cut loose. Kind of like controlling a brush fire to good ends. Some variations include: Compare Enemy Mine ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine"], for when the alliance with the evil/antagonistic character is less permanent. When you've got an evil person using a traditionally heroic role to cover up his behind-the-scenes evil, you have an Evil Hero on your hands. Contrast Big Bad Friend for where the teammate's evil nature is a shock revelation. For the inverse, see Token Good Teammate. Usually, but not always, a Nominal Hero. If the heroes actually like having them around, they may be Affably Evil. Otherwise, they often qualify as The Friend Nobody Likes. May be the subject of Speaking Up for Another.</hero:tropeDescription>
