    <hero:tropeDescription>When a main character or prominent member of the supporting cast all but disappears for a sequel, new season, adaptation, or The Movie ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie"]. While not completely written out, they are stripped of any plot importance in favor of a new role as background filler, at most giving a Mandatory Line or two before fading back into irrelevancy. The character's existing fanbase will complain, while everyone else may just accept it as the new status quo. Opposite of the Ascended Extra ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra"]; instead of a background or one-off character becoming a key member of the supporting cast, a key member of the supporting cast becomes a background or one-off character. And of Adaptational Protagonist, when either minor or major characters acquire the main lead role in an adaptation. Also contrast Spotlight-Stealing Squad, which can also cause this to happen; that said, there may not be anyone in particular that takes these characters' screentime, and the presence of a Spotlight Stealing Squad doesn't mean no one else is plot-important anymore. In works where Anyone Can Die, supporting characters fated to die may end up demoted to extra before their deaths. This trope is for characters who become unimportant to the story, but are still seen or mentioned occasionally; for characters who disappear completely from the story as if they had never existed, see Chuck Cunningham Syndrome ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome"] for when they disappear from the original work and Adapted Out for when they never appear in the adaptation. For when a character has (or multiple characters have) extended periods of irrelevancy within the same work to give others the spotlight, see Rotating Arcs. Super-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTrope"] to Demoted to Comic Relief and Demoted to Satellite Love Interest. Compare Shoo Out the Clowns, Sir Not-Appearing-in-This-Trailer, Not as You Know Them, The Artifact, Out of Focus, What Happened to the Mouse?, Chuck Cunningham Syndrome, and Commuting on a Bus. Contrast Ascended Extra, Breakout Character, and Ensemble Dark Horse.</hero:tropeDescription>
