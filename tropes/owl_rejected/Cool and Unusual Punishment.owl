    <hero:tropeDescription>There comes a time in every adventure show when the hero must face torture ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture"]. But beating and whipping is really dull for any self-respecting criminal mastermind. And more importantly, really dull for the audience, unless it's done so gruesomely that the Media Watchdogs complain. Besides, why beat the hero when you can torture them with the most horrible thing in the universe... six hours of opera ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoudOfWar"] (Scare Chord)! Or six hours of laxative commercials, or six hours of Céline Dion. Basically anything so bad that the Suckiness Is Painful. It would make anyone confess. A variant is for the villain to do torture that is so ridiculous and/or Faux Horrific ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxHorrific"] that it would never work, but everyone acts as if it would. When on the receiving end of the punishment, though, it's common for the villain to be showered by a neverending stream of rainbows, sugar, and Glurge, much to their horror and disgust. And it's always fun when one character has such offbeat tastes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooKinkyToTorture"] that they enjoy the experience. Typically, the form of punishment may be introduced as being harmless, only to be quickly revealed to be the opposite ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotSoHarmlessPunishment"]. Though not an unusual tactic for the Martial Pacifist ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist"], this is used most often in shows for kids, where showing the application of real torture methods would get the parents up in arms — especially when they find that they can't sleep afterward. Better to employ something ridiculous. The Punishment ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePunishment"] is when this happens to give the sufferer super powers. ...Why do people do this? When the Cool And Unusual Punishment is loud music or annoying sounds, the trope is Loud of War ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoudOfWar"]. See also Tickle Torture. The Maximum Fun Chamber ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaximumFunChamber"] and Room 101 often involve this, played for laughs and for drama, respectively. May serve as a Take That! ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat"]. For when someone merely threatens to do something like this, see Cut His Heart Out with a Spoon. Compare Cruel Mercy, Ironic Hell, Mundane Afterlife, and The Punishment Is the Crime. Compare and contrast Prank Punishment where something like this is indended as a playful punishment from a mentor or a loved one, rather than a type of torture. Also contrast Poke the Poodle. Not to be confused with Unishment, when it's the character who wants the punishment rather than the audience. When this involves sending somebody to a city that they may or may not hate, see Place Worse Than Death; when it involves just sending them anywhere that's dull and/or unpleasant, see Reassigned to Antarctica. Frequently follows the stock phrase "We Have Ways of Making You Talk!". Likely to be present in an Ironic Hell. Not the same as Cruel and Unusual Death ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath"].</hero:tropeDescription>
