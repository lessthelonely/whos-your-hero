    <hero:tropeDescription>In fiction, anyone caught unaware may be easily, instantaneously and noiselessly incapacitated with a single blow to the head (or alternatively, a karate chop to the neck). A character thus treated will usually be perfectly fine afterwards ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardHead"]; oh, they may have a headache, dizziness, slightly blurred vision, or in the very worst cases, Laser-Guided Amnesia, but this is nothing compared to the real danger — the Bad Guys standing around the operating table (or other heavy piece of furniture) to which they find themselves tied down. For heroes, this is the perfect way to dispatch the villains. When you knock them out cold, you don't have to worry about breaking any moral codes or violating the censors on weapons, guns and blood. In other words, when fictional characters take a blow to the head, they'll suffer nothing worse than an unplanned nap. (This is why In the Back does not apply — hitting someone from behind is not really dangerous.) For obvious reasons, not Truth in Television ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"]. Any sort of damage to the brain, even 'minor' trauma, can have devastating results. It's the difference between turning a computer off by shutting it down and by hitting it. The latter is likely to cause serious long-term damage. Most real-life unconsciousness due to injury lasts only a few seconds, not some indeterminate amount of time lasting hours or days during which our hero can be carted around, dressed/undressed etc. To K.O. someone for an extended amount of time requires a fair bit of force, and such an impact is going to leave visible damage to the head. If you are out longer than a few minutes, some combination of brain damage, coma, cranial bleeding, loss of motor and cognitive functions, and amnesia is going to greet you when you wake up — if you wake up. The "karate chop to the neck" version may have been removed from modern TV because if you hit the right spot it actually can knock you out, though not without serious risk of death. It utilizes the Carotid Sinus Reflex (the reason you should not take a pulse at the neck) and is very dangerous ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome"]. There have also been depictions in productions as varied as the lighthearted I Spy and as dark as Callan in which neck-chopping unambiguously is shown to be fatal because it breaks the target's neck, which circles back to unrealistic — breaking a person's neck takes a lot of force. Despite having very little grounding in reality, the Tap on the Head is still commonly applied in fiction — after all, Tropes Are Tools ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools"]. Maybe The Hero is a bit too good at their job, or the Big Bad's minions are getting too big for their britches and need an attitude adjustment, or the Tagalong Kid needs to be stopped from suffering (or causing) a fatal case of Cerebus Syndrome. Sometimes a brief bus trip is just something the plot needs to proceed, and rendering the offending character unconscious is a quick and easy excuse to get the ball rolling without actually killing them off. It might be justified if the character who's knocked out has super or magic powers of some kind (such as healing factors or invulnerability), as that would allow them to shake off something that would otherwise cause a concussion. Other variants of the trope: See also Frying Pan of Doom ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FryingPanOfDoom"], Rolling Pin of Doom, Back Stab, Blinded by the Light, Choke Holds, Instant Sedation, Pressure Point, Put Their Heads Together, Flower-Pot Drop. Contrast Death by Falling Over. Often leads to Waking Up Elsewhere. Pistol-Whipping is a Sub-Trope. Non-Lethal K.O. is a related trope in video games. Can be used to initiate an Injury Bookend.</hero:tropeDescription>
