    <hero:tropeDescription>Thanks to the magic of creators cutting corners to save time and money ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyArtist"], a character's irises suddenly disappear when he puts on a mask. In Comics and Western Animation, this is all but omnipresent, and has been since around 1950. Common reasons for this design include making characters appear mysterious and/or threatening. And then some simply do it for Rule of Cool ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool"]. Also compare with Expressive Mask ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpressiveMask"]. Note: Characters who have this incorporated into the design of their masks when it is off (e.g., Spider-Man ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan"] and the Clone Troopers) or already have Monochromatic Eyes do not count for this trope.</hero:tropeDescription>
