    <hero:tropeDescription>Simply put, it's when an enforcer of the rules thinks that they are exempt from those rules. Just as some think they are above the law because they can buy their way out of it ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney"], some think they are above the law because they enforce the laws. Through influence, political power, being in office, or sheer force, they believe that the law does not apply to them, or will allow them to do as they please. This is especially done by or in reference to the kinds of things that the laws are intended to protect against â€” corrupt policemen, politicians, gang leaders and the like. They can also said to be "a law unto themselves". Often expressed by the comment, "I am the (insert governing body here)! ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheNoun"]" (but saying it is not enough, there has to be some authority the character has). Probably inspired by "L'Etat, c'est moi" (I am the State.) from Louis XIV (although he may not have actually said it). To count as this trope, it needs to meet these points: What this is not: Screw the Rules, I Have Connections! ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections"] is when a friend or relative takes advantage of people who follow this trope. Compare, of course, Screw the Rules, I Have Money! ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney"], Appeal to Force, The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard, My Rules Are Not Your Rules, Because I Said So, Single-Target Law, Moving the Goalposts, and Loophole Abuse. Railroading, when done in defiance of the rules as written, qualifies too. Contrast Forgot I Could Change the Rules ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotICouldChangeTheRules"] (someone is empowered to change the rules, but forgets that power at first). A possible sub-trope of Straw Hypocrite ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawHypocrite"].</hero:tropeDescription>
