    <hero:tropeDescription>Clothing for characters will often be impractically sexy for their chosen application. Especially common in fantastic or exotic settings, where wardrobe rules are made up on the spot. Spies will dress in a Spy Catsuit ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpyCatsuit"] (often with high heels), even when the mission explicitly calls for them to not draw attention to themselves. Female warriors will charge into battle wearing a Chainmail Bikini. Bridge Bunnies on a military starship will be issued go-go boots and miniskirts with their uniforms. And then you have Role-Playing Games and the oft-parodied practice of having outfits that look practical on a male hero, but turn into lingerie if a female puts it on. Stripperiffic outfits on female characters — at least, young and attractive ones — are common in any genre where straight young men represent (or are assumed to represent) the core of the audience ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSells"]. This can be self-fulfilling, as sexually exploitative wardrobe choices can be a turn-off to potential female fans. This trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trope"] can be applied in the opposite direction; in the West, this takes the form of inserting 'exceptionally flattering' clothing (or lack thereof) for male roles, such as policemen, firemen, male gardeners, or pool boys, in traditionally female-oriented fare like soaps and prime-time dramas. In anime and manga, however (especially those aimed at a female audience), the Bishōnen can be as scantily clad as the girls. Rule of Sexy ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSexy"] is the Super-Trope. Compare Theiss Titillation Theory ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheissTitillationTheory"] and Go-Go Enslavement. For its Male counterpart, see Eating the Eye Candy, Hot Men at Work, and Walking Shirtless Scene. Contrast Stylish Protection Gear ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylishProtectionGear"], Battle Ballgown, Kicking Ass in All Her Finery.</hero:tropeDescription>
