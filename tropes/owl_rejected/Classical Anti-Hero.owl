    <hero:tropeDescription>Nowadays, an Anti-Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero"] is usually thought of as (when people don't confuse the term as synonymous with villain) an angry, bitter, misanthropic, violent, sociopathic badass, but this is a recent enough development to be known as a '90s Anti-Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero"]. For much of history, the term antihero referred to a character type that is in many ways the opposite of this. In classical ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology"] and earlier mythology, the hero tended to be a dashing, confident, stoic, intelligent, highly capable fighter and commander with few, if any, flaws and even fewer real weaknesses. The classical ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology"] antihero is the inversion of this. Where the hero is confident, the antihero is plagued by self-doubt. Where the hero is a respected fighter, the antihero is mediocre at best. Where the hero is brave and courageous, the antihero is frightened and cowardly. Where the hero gets all the ladies, the antihero can't even get the time of day. In short, while the traditional hero is a paragon of awesomeness, the classical antihero suffers from flaws and hindrances. The classical antihero's story tends to be as much about overcoming his own weaknesses as about conquering the enemy. As time has gone on, this portrayal has become increasingly popular, as readers enjoy the increased depth of story (and often relatability) that comes from a flawed and conflicted character. Hence, the classical antihero has to some extent replaced the traditional hero in the minds of readers as the idea of what a hero should be. It is nowadays rare to find a hero who does not have at least a little of the classical antihero in him. See also Punch-Clock Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockHero"]. Compare Super Loser and Tragic Hero. Contrast with The Ace and '90s Anti-Hero, but see also Byronic Hero, who may or may not be a complex variation of a classical antihero. A sidekick to a classical hero that otherwise fits the role of the trope would be The Lancer.</hero:tropeDescription>
