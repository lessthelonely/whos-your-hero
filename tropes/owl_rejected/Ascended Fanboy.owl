    <hero:tropeDescription>Some fans are a cut above the regular otaku ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku"]. For most, it is as simple as being hired to work in the industry that deals with the media you love, but in fiction, it can take a whole new meaning. The Ascended Fanboy/Fangirl is that lucky one-in-a-million with a hobby based on something imaginary which does not stay imaginaryâ€”it turns into reality, and he becomes a part of it himself. A variation is where it is imaginary to us but not in the context of the world, such as a mecha fan, in a world full of mecha, getting to pilot one. For those lucky few, they receive the Call to Adventure ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAdventure"], and ask: "How high?" Naturally, it is never so easy or glamorous as they thought it would be, but they've got the right stuff, and a whole lot of Beginner's Luck to last them until it comes out. As a side effect, they're usually Genre Savvy, sometimes to the point of excess. Of course you know, they could be wrong. Often a former The Team Wannabe ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeamWannabe"]. Who the fan works for is often their idol. Subtrope of Audience Surrogate. Compare The Knights Who Say "Squee!". Contrast with Loony Fan. See also I Know Mortal Kombat, which often results in this. Note: This trope is for in-universe examples. For the Real Life ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife"] counterpart, see Promoted Fanboy. This has nothing to do with that kind of ascension ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence"], at least unless the fan really likes Daniel Jackson.</hero:tropeDescription>
