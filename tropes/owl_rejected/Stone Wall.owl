    <hero:tropeDescription>If the Glass Cannon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon"] believes that the best defense is a good offense, the reverse is true of this guy. The Stone Wall's offense is nothing to write home about, if it even technically exists. But he's tough. Really, really tough. And if anything can put him down, odds are he's quick enough on the recovery to get right back up for round two. A Stone Wall's strategy is often known as "turtling". In warfare, the strategy is a battle of attrition to see who tires out or makes a mistake first. In sports, their favored tactic is a waiting game where they get an early lead and then just wait until time runs out. If his defense is something he physically constructs and builds, he can win a fight by slowly expanding outward until he leaves the enemy without a foot to stand on. Often has defensive buffs and minor healing magic, in which case you're dealing with a "Paladin Tank." In rare cases, he may also have access to Fixed-Damage Attacks ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedDamageAttack"], which by their very nature ignore stats, giving them at least a little access to actual offensive power. However, more offensively oriented characters will still always have a higher damage output with regular attacks. Although in very rare cases, typically at a high level, he'll gain access to an attack that scales off his Defense rather than his Attack, allowing him to finally deal some serious damage at last. Alternatively, Stone Walls can try the opposite tactic, berserking: throwing themselves at the enemy without a thought for defense. Relying on their inherent toughness to keep them alive, Stone Walls can use suicidal tactics ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack"] to make up for their dismal attack power. This strategy is especially common for Stone Walls whose toughness is completely automatic, rather than something they need to work at. In team settings, a Stone Wall often takes care of "tanking ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou"]" duties, interposing himself between the enemy and an ally, typically a Glass Cannon that can take care of dealing damage while the Stone Wall takes care of defense. By keeping the enemy occupied, he allows allies with greater attack strength but poorer defense to kill the enemy without getting killed. Characters who do this are called "Meat Shields" or "Party Tanks." They often have moves designed to force attention to themselves. Sometimes called "Control Tanks". In television shows, the Stone Wall is rarely the protagonist, because viewers want a main character who can kick ass themselves. This build has a number of flaws that can be exploited. Fixed ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedDamageAttack"] and percent damage attacks, along with armor piercing attacks, ignore their thick defenses. Defense-reduction debuffs may be somewhat effective in exposing them to peril, but Damage Over Time debuffs are invariably fatal unless cured. And if the break meter is directly tied to your defensive ability, expect anything with the ability to damage it to do so with extreme prejudice. An Instakill Mook will also be able to one-shot it as if its defenses aren't even there. The Stone Wall is very much a Blue Oni ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOniBlueOni"] method. Since it relies upon patience and endurance, over relentless assault, it is not unheard of for a Stone Wall to simply outlast their opposition. When time is especially crucial, the Stone Wall can be a nightmare to defeat, since they would most likely win by a time-out if their opponent fails to land a significant blow. This trope partly takes its name from a real-life example: Confederate General Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson won the Battle of Bull Run ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar"] due to his strategy to not retreat from his line, no matter how bad things went for him. And for a while, things went pretty bad. General Jackson himself is not an example of this trope despite the nickname, as outside of that particular battle, he was most noted for his offensive campaigns. Contrast Glass Cannon ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon"], which is the inverse with strong offense and weak defense, and Lightning Bruiser, which is tough and fast without sacrificing strength. Also contrast Mighty Glacier, who is strong but lacks speed; and Fragile Speedster, who has poor defence, but is fast. Not an unusual trait of the Weak, but Skilled, Gentle Giant, Cowardly Lion, or Iron Butt Monkey. Padded Sumo Gameplay is what happens when everyone in a game is a Stone Wall.</hero:tropeDescription>
