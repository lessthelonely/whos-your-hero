    <hero:tropeDescription>You're watching the dub of an anime or non-American animated series, playing a localized version of an imported game, or reading a book or manga/manhua/manhwa in translation. You stumble across a cultural reference that you're absolutely sure couldn't have been in the original ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism"] â€” it just seems too culturally out-of-place to have been in the original source. Except that it was in the original. Thanks to the increasingly international nature of popular culture, combined with Pop-Cultural Osmosis ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis"], an all-too-familiar cultural reference has managed to make its way halfway around the world, showing up in a completely unexpected place.</hero:tropeDescription>
