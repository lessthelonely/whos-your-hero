    <hero:tropeDescription>A character with their head in the clouds. They are very cheerful and strangely oblivious to things that everyone else takes for granted. They may have an argument with themselves for fun, make points in an argument with no basis in logic or reality ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic"], or tell rambling stories that have nothing to do with the point they're trying to make. They make totally unintentional double entendres, and are great for Getting Crap Past the Radar. Sometimes also called "Space Case" or "Space Cadet", or plain old "Strange", a cuckoo clock chime is used as an indicator of one. The concept is well known, as in this joke: "A neurotic is a man who builds a castle in the air. A psychotic is the man who lives in it. A psychiatrist is the man who collects the rent." — Jerome Lawrence Cloudcuckoolanders are rarely malicious ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonWithAHeartOfGold"]. They are far more likely to be the Plucky Comic Relief because of how much of a goofball they are. Maybe he's one of Those Two Guys or the crazy member of the Comic Trio. They lapse into non sequitur a lot, and while they aren't totally insane, they act it much more than some other crazier characters. They also talk like they're nuts as well by a speech pattern. One mark of a Cloudcuckoolander is when, 90% of the time, you think the character is just plain nuts, but 10% of the time, you suspect that the character is in fact the Only Sane Man ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan"] on the show. In other words, a Cloudcuckoolander has massive knowledge and understanding of the workings of the universe, but a poor way of communicating that to everyone else. Unfortunately, when they are smart, nobody else is, and when they are not, everybody else is. In any event, they can be oddly endearing. They often come off as naïve, innocent and Sarcasm-Blind ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmBlind"], so when they suddenly come up with snarky quips and witticisms, it may be one of the first indications that they are much more insightful than they seem (or even deliberately pretend) to be. Another notable mark is that often there is nothing actually wrong with what they do, but it is most assuredly not something a normal person would do. Sit down with a Cloudcuckoolander and try to explain to them that normal people don't wear the clothes of a dead man. They will never understand what your problem is. It's not like the dead guy cares, is it? Likewise, they would fail to understand the reason for wearing shoes in a public place (it's warm and cozy, so why not go barefoot ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarefootLoon"]?) or using the pronoun "I" when referring to yourself (you use other people's names when speaking about them, so why not use your own name when you speak about yourself?) Frequently clips entire stacks of Weirdness Coupons ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCoupon"] from the paper. Certainly, many of them get away with a good deal no one else would be allowed. And has a weakness for falling into a Wiki Walk. It should be noted that, though they may overlap with The Ditz ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz"], The Fool, or the Kindhearted Simpleton, a Cloudcuckoolander, by definition, isn't necessarily stupid. Many Cloudcuckoolanders can be highly intelligent, very insightful or even geniuses, it's just the things they sometimes say and do may come off as weird, awkward, clumsy, over-the-top, buffoonish, illogical and questionable, outright eccentric, goofy, etc. — and because imagination often runs wild, they tend to be Easily Impressed. This character is a mainstay of Surreal Humor ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurrealHumor"], Dada Comics, Quirky Work, and Word-Salad Humor. Even in a series with a little more structure overall, the Cloudcuckoolander's wacky and bizarre antics will often be used for an easy gag, particularly when paired with a straight foil to drive insane. This is probably why there are so many Webcomics examples. This character will often be a Granola Girl or New-Age Retro Hippie. When their weirdness delves into a disturbing territory, they have taken a job as a Nightmare Fuel Station Attendant ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuelStationAttendant"]. On rare occasions, a Cloudcuckoolander may become Bored with Insanity ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoredWithInsanity"] and become more normal. If this happens, sometimes it sticks, and sometimes a "we want our Cloudcuckoolander back" movement, subsequently getting bored with sanity too, or some other means of inducing insanity will make them a Cloudcuckoolander again (since, after all, Status Quo Is God). Their native land is Cloudcuckooland ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckooland"]. If a Cloudcuckoolander is dangerous, then that is the answer to Beware the Silly Ones ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSillyOnes"] and/or Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass. If they fight for a random rather than heroic reason, see Classical Anti-Hero or Nominal Hero. Because of the humor value in doing so, they're more likely than most characters to be a Spanner in the Works that stops a seemingly unstoppable plan, leaving viewers wondering if they were aware of what they were doing. For that reason, when it's time for a show to get serious, these characters are likely to be killed or detained so the viewers know they won't be responsible for yet another Deus ex Machina. The name of the trope comes from the city built on air above the Greek plain in Aristophanes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristophanes"]' play The Birds, 414 B.C., whose ruler had quite a large mental gap between the dreamy, wide-eyed, idealistic Utopia that he imagined his city to be and the brutal totalitarian regime that he had actually imposed on it. He also came up with brilliant ideas like keeping people out of his city — a city you could only reach through the flight — by building a really, really tall wall around it. (We'll give you a minute to figure out why that wouldn't have worked so well.) For various variants and overlapping tropes see: If written badly or subjected to Flanderization ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization"], a character who was supposed to be merely weird may become The Ditz or a full-time Talkative Loon. See also Cloudcuckoolander's Minder ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudcuckoolandersMinder"] for the person who — with or against their will — often accompanies the Cloudcuckoolander(s) and tries to prevent things from getting out of hand. This is usually an impossible task. See also Cuckoolander Commentator, when the Cloudcuckoolander is put in charge of commentary for an event. Also, if Only One Finds It Fun, expect the one to be a Cloudcuckoolander. Lastly, when dealing with Cloudcuckoolanders, always remember that sometimes their ramblings aren't just ramblings. That's The Cuckoolander Was Right ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCuckoolanderWasRight"]. No Real Life Examples, Please! ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/NoRealLifeExamplesPlease"]. There are several mental conditions that can result in this type of behavior but as mental illness is Serious Business in real life, providing examples would just be insensitive at best.</hero:tropeDescription>
