    <hero:tropeDescription>The character's thoughts are dubbed into the soundtrack, often with a slight reverb. This can be milked for comedy if the character switches from inner to outer monologue accidentally ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidIJustSayThatOutLoud"]. See Inner Monologue Conversation ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologueConversation"] for the frequently used subversion when other characters hear what is said and react to it or refer to it in their own thoughts, even though they shouldn't be able to. It's mostly used when two characters use this device in the same scene. If the character intentionally says this "out loud" to an empty room (the audience), then it is Thinking Out Loud ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkingOutLoud"]. Compare with Narrator ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator"], Captain's Log, and Sounding It Out. Contrast Surrogate Soliloquy, when the thoughts are forced out at an inanimate or nonsentient target to avoid voiceover. A closely related Video Game trope is Informing the Fourth Wall. May lead to Inner Thoughts, Outsider Puzzlement if you either spend too long monologuing or start acting weird while you're concentrating on your own thoughts. When overdone, it can raise the same problems as Talking Is a Free Action. Subtropes are Voiceover Letter, Ear Worm, and Private Eye Monologue.</hero:tropeDescription>
