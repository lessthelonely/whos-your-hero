Don't look at me like that, Tropey! ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppyDogEyes"] You know what'll happen if we keep you! Go on, get out of here! It's for your own good, damn it! Shoo! I gotta leave you behind, and there ain't two ways about it! Go! ... Goodbye, Tropey. I'll miss you. *sniffle* ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandInMyEyes"] When a character or animal is sent away, it's this trope.

Compare to Break His Heart to Save Him, But Now I Must Go, It's Not You, It's My Enemies, Line in the Sand, Shoo Out the Clowns. (Get out of the plot while you can, Tropey, Anyone Can Die now!) Some specific reasons for sending an animal/friend away, drawn from the examples below: Don't be surprised if, despite your best effort to spare them, they decide that You Are Worth Hell ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWorthHell"].</hero:tropeDescription>
