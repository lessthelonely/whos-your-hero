    <hero:tropeDescription>Purely mental exertion is hard to show. Sure, you can have a character sweat, strain, and clutch their head ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaGetYourHeadTogether"] as veins swell on their brow. But when a character with Telepathy or other Psychic Powers pushes them to the limit, or when a character is under mental intrusion or attack, or on the losing end of a duel with another psychic, nothing quite exemplifies the terrible intensity of their mental state like a thin trickle of blood oozing from their nose. Exactly how much damage this implies varies from place to place. Subtle cases can have a single drop; exaggerated ones can leak Blood from Every Orifice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromEveryOrifice"]. Within nodding distance of Truth in Television ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"], as rupture of the capillaries inside the nasal membranes is a recognized (albeit rare, and usually only seen in people already in poor health) symptom of dangerously high blood pressure, such as that caused by extreme emotional stress, physical strain, or (presumably) intense psychic effort. Sudden nosebleeds under stress have been known to precede strokes. Blood from the ears is even more worrying, because it's a highly recognisable sign of head trauma. An early example of the trope was the 1984 film adaptation of Firestarter ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Firestarter"], in which it's used in place of the original book's far-less-visible "tiny cerebral hemorrhages". However, the first actual depiction can be found in the film Scanners (pictured above), which came out a few years prior. Polite Dissent, a comics blog written by a physician, regularly provides examples of Psychic Nosebleed Zen, ["https://tvtropes.orghttp://www.politedissent.com/index.php?s=nosebleed&amp;submit=search"] which the author has dubbed "epistaxis telepathica." Sometimes overlaps with Deadly Nosebleed ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyNosebleed"] and may lead to Power-Strain Blackout if the psychic battle drags on for too long, or if the psychic pushes themselves to exertion. Only occasionally related to Blood from the Mouth. For nasal hemorrhages that are more of sexual ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice"] than psychic nature, see Nosebleed. For a psychic trope that may result in such, see Dirty Mind-Reading.</hero:tropeDescription>
