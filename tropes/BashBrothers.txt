Think about your closest friends. If you know them well enough, you also know their strengths and weaknesses. You know how they think, how they react, how they tick. You trust them to know the same about you, too. You might even trust them enough to let them fix your car — but not drive it. Hell would freeze over before you let them drive it.

In action oriented stories, two characters who are friends will work with each other during combat. Often this will present the image of Back-to-Back Badasses ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToBackBadasses"]. If one person is big and the other short, the big guy will use brute strength and the short guy will use finesse. Maybe the big guy will clasp hands with the short guy and fling him around as though he was a weapon. Or the big guy will use the short guy as a projectile.
No matter what, they will fight in tandem. They will watch each other's back. There is something genuinely satisfying about watching the heroes take out a room full of bad guys by working together.
Characters who tend to do this are The Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero"] and The Lancer because they are foils to each other and so their fighting style complements the other. Even a mismatched Action Duo can be Bash Brothers with enough bonding/training.
It is not uncommon in certain stories to have two separate badasses who come together, spend some time trying to kill each other only to eventually turn their skills onto the hapless enemy who happens to piss them both off. ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine"]
If the "brothers" are actually related by blood, it's a Sibling Team ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingTeam"]. Unrelated Brothers is when two unrelated characters claim to be this trope. A combative inversion is Fearful Symmetry. In a fantasy setting, they might be a Sword and Sorcerer. Not to be confused with the Smash Brothers who are, well, Super. The romantic version is the Battle Couple.

The name comes from the world of sports, where it refers to a pair of great players who end up on the same team. The first use of the term was in Baseball ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball"], where Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire formed a dangerous duo for the late-1980s-early-1990s Oakland A's on account of their incredible (and, as it turned out, steroid-fueled) power hitting (they would bash their forearms against each other whenever one of them made a great play, hence the name). It has since spread to other players and sports.
And yes, this trope happens with female fighting duos ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl"] as well, in which case we refer to them as Lovely Angels.
