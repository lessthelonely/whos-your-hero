Alice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAndBob"]'s life is going swell until she gains the ability to read minds. She becomes very distraught when she discovers that the vast majority of the people around her have rather disturbing thoughts, thoughts better left unread. Her friends are only using her. Her lover has been cheating since day one. People she passes in the street are brimming with barely-contained malice and pain. Every random guy she meets wonders what she looks like naked. Most likely, all of the above and more.
Much like the time she went on TV Tropes, Alice's gift ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice"] has ruined her life. She might opt on never using her powers in hopes of not alienating herself any further. If she's really unlucky, she won't be able to turn her power off. In this case, Alice will probably end up becoming a jaded misanthrope, a doleful hermit, or maybe just really depressed. It's certainly understandable that Alice may wish to remove or disable her powers somehow.
This trope is a prime example of Humans Are Flawed ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed"]. In more extreme examples, this trope might be evidence of a Crapsack World, and you can expect people to act like assholes as well as think like them. A villain may start out with this trope, and then go on to contemplate The Evils of Free Will.
Dirty Mind-Reading ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyMindReading"] is a Sub-Trope.
See Also: Unhappy Medium ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnhappyMedium"], Black Bug Room, and some types of Insanity Immunity. See Psychic Static and Poke in the Third Eye for cases where the target deliberately dredges up disturbing mental images to mess with the mind-reader. May intersect with These Are Things Man Was Not Meant to Know if the read thought is really terrible.
