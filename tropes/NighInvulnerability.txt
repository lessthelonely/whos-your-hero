Someone cannot be harmed. Merely fighting them won't make them go away; if at all possible their defeat requires one to figure out how, which is a legendary quest in and of itself. Usually the ability of the Big Bad ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad"] in sci-fi and fantasy settings, few heroes get this one. (Except in Super Hero series, with Superman being the flagship example.)
Either one has to find their Achilles' Heel ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel"], or else summon up a nuclear-bomb's worth of power in the last episode, either through The Power of Love or Ki Manipulation or really heavy armaments (e.g. When All You Have Is a Hammerâ€¦) and hope for Villain Decay.
Sometimes a vaguely defined nigh-invulnerability is a way to make a hero only as tough as he needs to be to advance the plot ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe"].
There's a number of ways one can have Nigh Invulnerability.
A combination of limited super-toughness, super-pain tolerance and regeneration is a popular power set ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers"] to render a character effectively nigh-invulnerable while still being shown to suffer temporary pain and injury in a way that gives recognisable stakes to physical threats, even if we know they won't be fatal.
The Physical God ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod"], Implacable Man, The Juggernaut, Blob Monster, Iron Butt Monkey, The Chew Toy, and anything Made of Indestructium all probably have some form of Nigh Invulnerability.
Compare of course Immortality ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality"], for the ways in which characters cannot die. Contrast Made of Iron, where no explanation is given for an individual's incredible resilience. See also Immortal Life Is Cheap, which applies to such cases as Multiple Bodies or Regeneration; and Trainstopping which tends to have this as a requirement. When someone is invulnerable to literally everything, then it becomes Complete Immortality ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality"].
