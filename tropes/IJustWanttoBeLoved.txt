A character motivation trope. A very fundamental thing that people want out of life is to feel loved, in fiction as in real life â€” whether by a specific person ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited"], an unspecified but worthy "Mr. Right"... or by as many people as possible.
Wish-Fulfillment ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishFulfillment"] is an undeniable part of all fiction, and there is nothing at all wrong with it, in and of itself. I Just Want To Be Loved is a specific wish that some members of the audience would like to have fulfilled by the fiction they consume.
This wish is usually (but definitely not exclusively) expressed by females. Because men are more likely to be judged on specific actions and accomplishments and women are more likely to be judged on characteristics like personality and appearance ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenActWomenAre"], men are more likely to be focused on personal achievements and women are more likely to be focused on general lovability. This trope is seen as having its share of Unfortunate Implications about what women should aim for in life (though not always).
