Well, Everyone Loves Blondes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneLovesBlondes"], Heroes Want Redheads, and of course there's the sensual Brunette. But for men, there seems to be one main perceived ideal: Tall, Dark, and Handsome. Sometimes, it's a Tall, Dark, and Handsome Stranger.
Tall, Dark, and Handsome Stranger was a pulp fiction trope, particularly in mystery novels. Romance novels ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceNovel"] still play it straight sometimes. This then led to a Tall, Dark, and Handsome casting trope for leading men: Clark Gable, etc. This is also one of the defining attributes of the Latin Lover stereotype.
Historically, "dark" referred to the man's hair and often eyes, not necessarily his skin color. If the man had "dark" skin too, it was meant to refer to a "healthy" or "bronzed" i.e. tanned complexion at best, as opposed to being too pale or "pasty", and connoting an active lifestyle, getting out in the sun and doing proper manly stuff like horse-riding or hunting. By default he was assumed to be white due to society frowning on interracial relationships ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalignedMixedMarriage"], to put it mildly. So while the phrase could literally apply to a black man, it's unlikely to be used this way unless it's in a modern work, and thus a slight subversion.
Most Tall, Dark and Handsome men display an aloof, cold, and distant personality, but they do have a gentle and caring side ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarAndIcePersonality"].
Being one of the oldest tropes in the book, it's nowadays more often used in subversions and deconstructions ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope"]. The actual invocation of the trope Tall, Dark, and Handsome Stranger is often parodied or might be played straight but usually isn't highlighted if it is.
