    <hero:tropeDescription>Some people receive the Call to Adventure ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAdventure"], but others are left waiting by the phone. Some will be lucky enough to quickly find a thing they can do. There are others who have to search a little bit more. The person who is Desperately Looking for a Purpose in Life is searching for what they could be good at or what would spiritually satisfy them and will try every possibility, even the most outlandish and odd. Obviously, with little or no success. If for some reason they succeed in their new field, they will still feel empty and will quickly abandon the effort at the first chance, going back to the pursuit of their "destiny". Alternatively, the character indeed had found that satisfactory goal of life in the past ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryDays"], but life circumstances had irrevocably separated them from it. Broken-hearted, they try with other things, often without success. In this case, they will abandon whatever they're doing if there is even a minimal chance of going back to the way it was. If it's a musical, expect this to be expressed with an "I Want" Song ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantSong"] or a Wanderlust Song. As the first tab below may suggest, there seems to be a specific Japanese variant of this trope, the "(Male) Ordinary High-School Student ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent"] burdened heavily by ennui at the lack of individual freedom and excitement offered by the modern Japanese lifestyle," who usually gets swept up into wacky hijinks, which frames a Wish-Fulfillment fantasy for the audience to relate to, but occasionally they have to cope with that dull world in some way. This variant of the trope is particularly likely to display overt symptoms of clinical depression without them being considered in that light. This is what happens when those that Just Wanted to Be Special ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial"] and would have Jumped at the Call never get the opportunity. They just never found their Goal in Life. Compare Living Is More than Surviving, the basis of this trope where a purpose beyond survival is necessary for life. Contrast Straw Nihilist, who believes there is no purpose to find in life and endlessly rants about it, and The Anti-Nihilist who tries to find one knowing there is no inherent meaning and/or who appreciates life for what it is. Compare and contrast Allergic to Routine. Contrast Unfulfilled Purpose Misery, where the character knows what their purpose is, but not being able to carry it out causes problems. Truth in Television ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"] for almost every person at some point in their lives. People who long for a sense of purpose are targeted by military recruiters, cults and protester organizations, because being part of an organization can give a sense of purpose. People with Depression are particularly prone to this.</hero:tropeDescription>
