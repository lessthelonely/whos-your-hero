Raising children is one of the most daunting challenges a parent can face. You have to supply material needs like food and shelter, as well as providing a moral education by teaching through example. You can see where this would be problematic when a parent supplies the latter by breaking kneecaps or threatening global annihilation.

Some parents make ends meet through frowned-upon trades like prostitution, others turn to crime, some master crime and become The Don ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDon"], and there's more than a few Super Villains who start families... unintentionally. The thing is, not every villain turned parent is a sociopath who chastises Overlord Jr. for not being evil enough. Quite a few realize the choices they have made, that the life they lead is a fundamentally destructive one, and don't want their child to mimic them as a family legacy. Sometimes the parents were forced into their way of life due to circumstances beyond their control, and want to ensure that their children never have to make the same choice.
What ends up happening is that the dad (and it's usually the dad who's the villain) hides his villainy one way or another. The easiest and hardest is to give the child up for adoption or abandon the mother. Non-deadbeats create a Secret Identity ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity"] where they have a mundane, even boring job. If he doesn't bother hiding his nasty day job, he will either whitewash it to not seem villainous (replace "mob hit" with "rat infestation", for example) or say "do what daddy says, not what daddy does" without a trace of shame. If he's possessive and/or overprotective and has the means to, his children may become a Lonely Rich Kid Mafia Princess who is trapped in a Gilded Cage.
Of course, their kid is going to find out the truth and either be horrified ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut"] at the Double Standard, or naively eager to become their dad's sidekick. Sometimes, to Dad's dismay, they will prove that villainy is part of their Villainous Lineage despite his best intentions. The realization (and some heroic coercion over revealing the truth to his kids) may lead to pulling a Heelâ€“Face Turn.
