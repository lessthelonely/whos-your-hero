    <hero:tropeDescription>The Cynicism Catalyst is a traumatic, disillusioning event that drives many heroes to more morally dubious methods ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityAdjustment"] or outright antivillainy. Before, they were more idealistic, but after this event they became more cynical and felt that the current way things are done just wasn't enough. Frequently, this means either picking up less traditionally heroic methods or deciding the established way of doing things is simply not good enough. It won't happen again. Frequently, the event is the death of an innocent family member (like a parent ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceasedParentsAreTheBest"] or beloved sibling), a close friend, or a love interest. Apart from this, a Broken Pedestal can cause this sort of personality change if the character lets it affect them too strongly. After the catalyst takes effect, the character will generally turn broodier and less open to companionship. Many works will be dedicated at least in part to getting this character to open up, let it go, and move on. This makes them vulnerable to Morality Pets ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet"] and sudden bursts of moral insight. Sadly, sometimes they just can't do it or they feel that it's too late. Expect a Hollywood Atheist ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAtheist"] to have one of these to explain why he or she does not believe in God. An outright villain will generally not have a Cynicism Catalyst: The trope is reserved for those who are still attempting to do good, leaving it the domain of the Anti-Hero, the Anti-Villain, and the Well-Intentioned Extremist. Compare Death by Origin Story ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory"] for something that spurred a hero into action, Took a Level in Cynic for a character who becomes more cynical but may remain a good person, and Freudian Excuse for pure villains. For a more prolonged wearing down of idealism into cynicism, see Stopped Caring. Also compare Heroic BSoD and Despair Event Horizon for more seriously disabling breaks. Some of the examples that follow also fall under one or more Death Tropes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrope"]. Most spoilers will be unmarked ahead. Beware.</hero:tropeDescription>
