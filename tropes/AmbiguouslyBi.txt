Romantic relationships ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTropes"], sex, and romantic and sexual attraction are staples of fiction, and — unless you're dealing with asexual and aromantic characters or a No Hugging, No Kissing setting — characters will express at least some desire for it. The vast majority of the time, male characters are attracted to women, and female characters are attracted to men, there are some homosexual characters, and very rarely you'll get a bisexual character (unless it's a Queer Romance, where naturally the last two categories are more common), but others aren't so definite. Sometimes there's a male/female character who doesn't express interest in women/men but does seem to show interest in people the same gender as themself; they're Ambiguously Gay. Then there are characters that seemingly show romantic and/or sexual interest in people of multiple genders; they're Ambiguously Bi.
Most of the time, this character's interest in people of a different gender is explicitly stated or written to be obvious, while their interest in people of the same gender is subtle or downplayed, but the inverse does exist. Characters with a Heterosexual Life Partner ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners"] are especially prone to this. Sure, they might have an actual love interest of a different gender or try to get a love interest through flirting and having crushes on men/women. Still, the relationship with their HLP often has a romantic/sexual element as well. Getting Crap Past the Radar can be a reason for this trope, the writers wanting to include hints a character is gay or bi but with enough heterosexuality to appease the Moral Guardians.
It should be noted that what makes a character Ambiguously Bi and what differentiates them from Bisexual ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bisexual"] characters is largely a matter of opinion. The character does not have to officially be declared bi to qualify, and as No Bisexual ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bisexual"]s demonstrates, even if a character is clearly bisexual to the audience (or at least some segments of it), much of the time the writers don’t consider it as a possibility. Obviously, some form of attraction to people of different genders is required, but the exact extent varies; for some people, an offhand comment or a prolonged glance can be enough; for others, nothing short of onscreen sex can suggest bisexuality as a possibility. Characters who express If It's You, It's Okay further muddle the issue, as by definition, that makes a character bisexual, but there are otherwise straight and gay people in real life who do have exceptions to the "rule" of their sexuality.
This can overlap with Word of Gay ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGay"] if the character's bisexuality remains ambiguous within the work itself, but is directly declared elsewhere by a creator.

A No Recent Examples ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/NoRecentExamplesplease"] rule applies to this trope. Examples for episodic works shouldn't be added until end of season for the season introducing the ambiguity (or after 3 months, for episodic works without seasons). This is to allow time for the story to develop the character and resolve ambiguity. There is no waiting time for non-episodic works.
