Alice is in love with Bob, but Bob is in love with Charlie, while Charlie is in love with Alice, i.e. a love triangle. Well, that's just one of many versions ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/LoveTriangle"]. A Love Triangle commonly involves three people, love, and decisions.

Sometimes a Love Triangle can come to involve a fourth person, while still ultimately being called a "triangle." ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonindicativeName"] But more complications that result from widening it can be explored further in a Love Dodecahedron.

Very common in Soap Opera ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera"]. Compare Friend Versus Lover and Cock Fight.
