The Female Gaze ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaze"] is a Gaze ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaze"] trope about the way a work is presented from a female perspective or reflects female attitudes, either because of the creator's gender or because it is deliberately aimed at a female audience. Although looking at sexy men can contribute to it, Female Gaze ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaze"] is not restricted to that but is more importantly about the expectations of how the (presumptive) audience relate to the work.
Female Gaze is a Distaff Counterpart ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart"] to Male Gaze. It is generally less common than its Spear Counterpart, and this is largely believed to be due to Most Writers Are Male.
