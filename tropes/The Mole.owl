    <hero:tropeDescription>A hero or villain who is secretly working for the other side. Their job is to gather intel for their superiors and/or sabotage the other side's efforts while their supposed comrades are none the wiser. In most cases, the audience is unaware that a character is a mole until the big reveal. In others, the audience is fully aware that a character is a spy, and the work will utilize Dramatic Irony ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony"] as they try to hide their identity and motivations from their "colleagues". If one of the heroes had been in a romantic relationship with the Mole ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterestTraitor"] before The Reveal, they may ask "Was It All a Lie?" Particularly heartless Moles may reveal that yes, I Was Only Pretending To Like You and gleefully taunt them over it, while others may have indeed developed feelings for the person being betrayed and may wind up Becoming the Mask. If The Mole is also a fake Heel–Face Turn ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn"], they're a Fake Defector. If someone isn't The Mole, but it looks like they are, they’re a Red Herring Mole. If a person is unaware that someone is a mole on the other side, they may be Mistaken for Betrayal, leading to Mistakenly Attacked Mole. Compare Big Bad Friend ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadFriend"] (an actual friend who is nevertheless a villain), Evil All Along (if the mole was pretending to be a hero but turned out to be on the villain's side), Turncoat, and Les Collaborateurs. Contrast Friendly Enemy (a known villain who is nevertheless a friend). See also The Infiltration for the short-term version, and Mole in Charge for particularly successful spies who wind up the boss. Ten Little Murder Victims ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenLittleMurderVictims"] is an example of a plot concerning the hunt for The Mole. A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing is The Mole via false identity. Flock of Wolves is a group where everyone is The Mole. And Social Deduction Game is when players have to actively find out who the mole is and/or succeed despite the mole's machinations. Not to be confused with the Reality TV series of the same name ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMole"] (though it's all about this trope), The Mole from Thunderbirds (which is a digging machine), The Little Mole, the Dick Tracy villain, Mole Men, Mole Miner, 6.02×1023,note a unit of measure known in chemistry as a "mole" beauty marks, the Mexican chocolate sauce, the Happy Tree Friends character, or the animal, of course.</hero:tropeDescription>
