A dandere will be more or less a normal person, but, will not talk unless spoken to/required to. They will avoid talking because of their shyness, but if need be, they will speak. Also, a dandere tends to feel more power in numbers. If they're with a group that they're comfortable with, then the shyness factor of said dandere will very likely decrease if another, unfamiliar person is introduced at that time.
The name comes from an abbreviation of 'danmari deredere'. 'Danmari' means to be calm or to shut one's mouth up all the time, while 'deredere' means lovestruck.
See The Quiet One ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne"], Shrinking Violet and Sugar-and-Ice Personality for the more general term and examples. Not to be confused with Dan Dare, or shed flakes of skin.
