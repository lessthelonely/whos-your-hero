    <hero:tropeDescription>Sometimes, people just can't be fussy when it comes to getting what they need. Everyone Has Standards ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards"], but some standards just aren't worth suffering for. That goes double when said standards are about things like food and clothing; when it comes down to survival or being choosy, most people would choose survival. As such, there come times when a character would do anything to satisfy a physical or emotional need. Hungry characters will be willing to Eat Dirt, Cheap ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatDirtCheap"] if it means they can get something in their stomach. A person desperate for a friend will be willing to win over the first person they see on the street, personality and common interests tossed out the window. Someone who needs medical attention will be more likely to trust the Snake Oil Salesman with a supposed "universal cure" than someone in better shape. In general, this trope happens when a character is in serious need of something related to their own well-being, or occasionally someone else's, to the point that they'd willingly do something that would otherwise be highly unpleasant, or even risky. When the choice is something moral, you have I Did What I Had to Do ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo"]. The trope is most often used when a character is desperate for food or water, but it's not the only scenario. Often Played for Drama ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama"], but can be Played for Laughs. In certain situations, this trope might overlap with a few others, including: Closest Thing We Got ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosestThingWeGot"], in cases where, for example, a wounded character has to get help from a dentist because it's all they have; O.O.C. Is Serious Business, if a character violates their own set standards in an act of desperation; No Party Like a Donner Party, if they're resorting to cannibalism to stave off starvation; and One-Track-Minded Hunger. Compare Too Hungry to Be Polite ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooHungryToBePolite"], Moment of Weakness, and Ain't Too Proud to Beg. Might result from Would Rather Suffer, Anything but That!, or Exhaustion-Induced Idiocy, and may occur to people living After the End. Supertrope of Dog Food Diet and Reduced to Ratburgers. When not even the fact that they are desperately needy will make someone accept a certain kind of donation, see this trope's inversion: Even Beggars Won't Choose It. See Choosy Beggar for the opposite.</hero:tropeDescription>
