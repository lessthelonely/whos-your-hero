This character simply can't die. This is because they are both of the following:
Note that "mere" Ageless characters who can regenerate from a drop of their blood cell ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell"] or survive point-blank nukes and the like, are not enough to qualify. To be this trope, a character must be unkillable by at least all physical means, such as by endlessly resurrecting every time you kill them, being Barred from the Afterlife and so can't move on, or being blessed/cursed by God or other similar entities so that they won't die.
Most Physical Gods ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod"] or Powers That Be fall into this category, as do a lot of Cosmic Entities and Anthropomorphic Personifications. A Time Abyss will tend to be this as well, as accidents tend to happen over the millennia, and invulnerability is needed to keep them going. Most fictional souls also fit under this, if the work contains evidence of their existence. Ghosts can be banished to the underworld or sent on to the next life but not killed. Though there are exceptions.
This form of immortality can often be seen as a curse ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever"] or a blessing. This is also the end-goal for the most ambitious Immortality Seekers, although it's rare indeed for them to achieve it. More commonly they have to settle for lesser and more impaired forms of immortality like Soul Jars, Fountains of Youth, or Life Drinking.
Also note that just because they are unkillable doesn't mean they are unbeatable. A sufficiently powerful character could still ruin their plans or subject them to a fate worse than death or imprison them for eternity or cause a shift in morality or amnesia.
This is a subtrope of Immortality ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality"]. Compare Only Killable at Home, which grants a character some variation of this outside their point of origin.
