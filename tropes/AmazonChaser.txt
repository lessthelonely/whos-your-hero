This is the guy who finds a lady attractive because ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIsSexy"] of her Amazon-ness. For instance, the guy could be looking for a Violently Protective Girlfriend, the other half of his Battle Couple, or finds a woman who refuses to submit and challenges him very enticing, or is just entranced by her unbridled power. Nothing would thrill him like getting plucked off the ground in an Effortless Amazonian Lift and carried away by her.
She herself could be The Protagonist ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist"] who needs a guy who can appreciate a girl who's stronger, tougher, faster, and more aggressive than himself. Or she could just be a Girl of the Week for The Hero who prefers this type. She can even be an antagonist while the hero falls in Love at First Punch, and the harder she pummels him the more he wants to romance her.
If the guy is simply attracted to her Heroic Build ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild"] instead of her badass feats then he is not this trope. Instead he is an example of Has a Type (with the "type" being muscular girls). She may be an Amazonian Beauty, Statuesque Stunner (or Giant Woman), or Ms. Brawn (from Beauty, Brains, and Brawn trio), and all of these are considered attractive by many. But unless this guy is also attracted to her strength and prowess, he doesn't qualify.
The genderflips are Women Prefer Strong Men ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenPreferStrongMen"] (a female who is attracted to strong men) and All Amazons Want Hercules (a strong woman is attracted to a man who's stronger than she is). The flip-side proper (and thus where all Aversions, Subversions, and Inversions go) is No Guy Wants an Amazon.
Not to be confused with an Amazon Brigade ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade"] or Amazonian Beauty or the actual geographic location.
Her side of the relationship might be Weakness Turns Her On ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaknessTurnsHerOn"].
Remember, this is not solely about attractive Action Girls ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl"]. This is about someone being attracted to action girls in-universe because they are action girls. (Though the Action Girl's attractiveness is, logically, not completely out of the question. It is just incidental or a bonus on atop of the fighting ability.)
