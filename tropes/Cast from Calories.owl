    <hero:tropeDescription>Typically, Functional Magic ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic"] is assumed to rely on some universal, pervasive force, like a Background Magic Field, as its mana fuel source. Alternately, it might be drawn from the collective Life Energy of the local environment. In a pinch, it could come from helpful gods. But if these aren't available, it might just be possible for a supernatural being to utilize the stored caloric energy of their own body as a power source. This might be a desperation tactic or the only option in the setting. From a physics standpoint, this actually makes a surprising amount of sense. There's enough chemical energy in a living person to make a reasonably powerful bomb, if it were possible to combust it all at once. If we assume magic has some means of efficiently converting calories into the proper form, the results could be very noticeable- and the subject would find their last few meals negated, if not suddenly suffering malnutrition. Of course, the effectiveness of this process tends to be heavily exaggerated; similarly, the amount one can eat at one time in order to recompense this usage tends also to be exaggerated; many magical entities are Big Eaters ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater"] who can easily wolf down massive amounts of food, which is apparently changed instantly to a metaphysical form that doesn't take up physical space. It can be hard to separate this trope from its close relative, Cast From Hitpoints ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitpoints"], and indeed they can easily overlap, as the difference between physical bodily energy and the metaphysical concept of Life Energy can be hard to clarify. To distinguish them, consider the following question: when feeling the effects of supernatural overexertion, which would be a better remedy, a night's sleep or a solid meal? This trope can also easily overlap with Hyperactive Metabolism ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperactiveMetabolism"], which entails a boost to natural abilities, usually in the form of healing, from eating. Despite the name, has nothing to do with Wizard Needs Food Badly, a video game trope involving the need for food as an arbitrary restriction.</hero:tropeDescription>
