    <hero:tropeDescription>Being paired up with a badass never ends well for the other person. Any Love Interest ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests"] that the hero meets will be either killed off or otherwise removed forever from his or her life by the end of the episode or arc. Named for the hunky Cartwright family, father and three sons, of Bonanza. This also happened in the case of any love interest of the males on Bonanza's competitor, The Big Valley (or maybe not just the males; after all, their mother was a widow when the show opened and their sister wasn't exactly lucky in love herself). If the two of them wind up getting married, it's even worse — chances are that the Love Interest ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests"] won't even make it to the honeymoon, or even through the ceremony! Often a case of women in refrigerators. If they're together at the end of an arc, be prepared for Sudden Sequel Death Syndrome ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenSequelDeathSyndrome"] in the next one. If the show has any amount of spy intrigue, there is at least a 50% chance that the new love interest is working for the other side and/or milking the relationship for intel; on intrigue-heavy shows such as 24 and Alias, this probability approaches 100%, and odds are good that the hero will be required to personally contribute to his or her sweetie's demise. Puts the "Temporary" in Temporary Love Interest ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryLoveInterest"] and serves as the "Yank" in Yank the Dog's Chain. Don't expect these widow(er)s to be particularly shook up at this untimely parting. The reason for all this romance being cut short (besides an authorial inclination for their heroes to stay single and available ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroesStaySingle"]) is the fact that many villains just can't resist tormenting the hero however they can, particularly by going after friends, family and loved ones (and even the Team Pet!) of the hero. It's little wonder that many Celibate Heroes (who have likely been through this multiple times) have an "It's Not You, It's My Enemies" speech handy. Doom Magnets suffer this by definition, but it isn't limited to romantic relationships — anyone who gets close to them is doomed. Perhaps the greatest reason why heroes never find lasting love is that having a loved one around will smooth down the rough edges that make them such a hit with the crowd, and character decay gradually — though not always ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools"] — sets in. Some authors would rather leave a character to deal with their struggles on their own to show how hardened they are, rather than using love to deal with these issues because they have a sweetheart to go to that can make it all better. However, if the character is enhanced by the presence of their beloved, the opposite can happen, where they really are Happily Married, usually after a drawn-out period of toying with the idea, and the two go on to have children who have their own challenges ahead of them, thus breaking the curse. In TV series, this is often caused by the closely related trope Status Quo Is God ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod"]. Fatal Attractor is a variation of this, except that the love interests in question usually survive, but prove to be woefully unsuitable for the hero in some way, if they don't turn out to be bad guys. Sometimes the two of these are combined, making for a character who really can't catch a break in the romantic department. In long running shows, Long-Runner Cast Turnover will virtually guarantee this. (See the Trope Namer, Bonanza, for an example.) Compare Her Heart Will Go On ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerHeartWillGoOn"], a variation where the love interest is killed off to show how strong and empowered a female protagonist is. Expect the Crusading Widow to have new potential love interests die to not distract them from their vengeance, or grow disgusted with the edgy nature of the character and ultimately be turned off of him.</hero:tropeDescription>
