"First Love ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLove"] is the Best Love", that's what they say. Who "they" are is a mystery, but they are (occasionally) wrong. In reality, many people fall in love a second, third, or even fourth time. Despite the First Girl Wins trope, there are many cases when the second girl (not necessarily Last Girl) ends up with the guy. This happens with the guy as well, but not as often. This is not to say that first love can't ever work out, this trope applies to when the first love does not work out and is relevant.
Reasons for the first love not working out vary. The person may have cheated on their significant other, turned evil, or even died. Widowing is popular, as it allows the old love interest to be "out of the way ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheHypotenuse"]" without ruining the dignity or reputation of either of the pair (especially if the deceased is played up as having been Too Good for This Sinful Earth). Often, for added tension, the first and second loves know each other, or may have been sworn enemies. In some more supernatural cases, the second love happens to look exactly like the first one.
A common ploy is to find the second love to be "true" or "real" love, compared to the first. But unlike The Casanova ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova"], the Casanova Wannabe and even the Chivalrous Pervert, they definitely felt something for the first love.
Quite often the result of Wrong Guy First ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGuyFirst"] — which may make Silly Rabbit, Romance Is for Kids! complicate this. Single Woman Seeks Good Man is more likely to succeed All Girls Want Bad Boys than the other way round.
