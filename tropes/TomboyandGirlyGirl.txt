When the main characters in a show are both females, or if there are only Two Girls to a Team ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoGirlsToATeam"], it almost always leads to a case of this trope. The "Girly Girl" will highly care about her appearance, pursue "girly" interests, and is often (though not always) The Heart or the Team Mom. The "Tomboy", who is often The Big Girl, will be into sports, mechanics, house and/or building construction and/or renovation, or the like. She couldn't care less about her hair or makeup but is often an Unkempt Beauty anyway. Like their Spear Counterparts, Sensitive Guy and Manly Man, they are candidates for an Odd Couple and Odd Friendship brought together in the attempt to make hilarity ensue.
The two ladies will have some sort of relationship with each other, whether they're best friends, sisters, on the same team, or even explicit lovers. Even when they aren't explicit lovers, this may lead to deliberate or accidental Homoerotic Subtext ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomoeroticSubtext"] due to the overlap with the Masculine–Feminine Gay Couple stereotype. If they're together for reasons outside their control (e.g., part of a team), they might initially dislike or confuse each other with their ways, until the inevitable Girl's Night Out Episode forces them to put aside their differences and forge a common bond (note: if there are more than two girls in the group, these two must have some kind of relationship over the others). When one is the mother of the other, the mother will almost always be the girly girl, and the daughter will almost always be the tomboy. If they're female twins, chances of this trope are more than fair. If they are sisters of different ages, the older sister will almost always be the girly girl, and the younger sister will almost always be the tomboy.
This trope can find itself incarnated in musical theater with the Soprano playing the girly girl and the Mezzo/Alto (or, face it, any female with a significantly lower vocal range) playing the tomboyish one, or the girly girl role being the role that requires a lot of singing, while the tomboy role requires more dancing.
It may lead to Fan Dumb ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb"] or Hate Dumb if one is portrayed as being "better" than the other, if the girly girl is portrayed as shallow or less strong, or if the tomboy is portrayed as a cold man-hater or even Ambiguously Gay for taking a less traditional gender role. Works that involve Values Dissonance are particularly vulnerable to this. At its most extreme, it reinforces the mindset that Men Are Generic, Women Are Special, where males on the team have varied personalities unrelated to their gender (due to maleness being seen as normal) while the females are defined by their femininity or lack thereof (thus limiting their characterization and role variety).
Compare the mannish one and the sweet-naive one of the Four-Girl Ensemble ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourGirlEnsemble"].
Feminine Mother, Tomboyish Daughter ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeminineMotherTomboyishDaughter"] is a Sub-Trope that uses this contrast to explore changing gender norms. Tender Tomboyishness, Foul Femininity is another subtrope where the tomboy is nice while the girly girl is mean.
Compare/contrast Bifauxnen and Lad-ette ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BifauxnenAndLadette"] (the equivalent of this trope, only without the girly girl involved), Light Feminine and Dark Feminine (the other equivalent, usually without the tomboy: although if the tropes are used together then the Dark half is usually the tomboy and the Light half is the girl girl), and Masculine–Feminine Gay Couple (an equivalent involving a couple). Contrast Silk Hiding Steel, Spirited Young Lady, Girly Bruiser, Lady of War, and often Pretty Princess Powerhouse; all of which are a mixture of the two. When a third girl is part of the dynamic but does not fit in either category, then she's among the Town Girls (Butch, Femme and Neither).
