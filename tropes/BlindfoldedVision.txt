The self-imposed version of being a Blind Seer ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindSeer"] or Blind Weaponmaster. A sighted character who has blindfolded vision can see just as well, if not better than if that character wasnâ€™t blindfolded. The reasons for this vary, a mentor teaching the student that Your Eyes Can Deceive You may take it to the next level, invoking Disability Superpower and complementing it with Charles Atlas training to grant Super-Senses, freeing the student from the tyranny of sight. Another possibility is the character's Psychic Powers and Third Eye are enhanced with sensory deprivation, or the blindfold is itself a powerful artifact that confers sight beyond sight a la X-Ray Vision.
Perhaps the most terrifying option is that the blindfold is a self-imposed handicap ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter"] to keep an eye-related power under control. When the blindfold comes off, people fall down. Most importantly, Blindfold Vision provides copious quantities of cool.
