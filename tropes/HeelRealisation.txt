Few things are more crushing ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD"] than realizing that you're one of the bad guys. You might exclaim My God, What Have I Done? (or something like it) and perhaps shed Tears of Remorse. Or in some cases, you realize you're even worse than you thought you were. Either way, it's the moment you know you're in the wrong.
It may lead to becoming The Atoner ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner"], a Redemption Quest, or Redemption Equals Death, or, if the author is feeling particularly vindictive, to a Heel–Face Door-Slam. Conversely, may turn a Well-Intentioned Extremist Necessarily Evil, or force them to admit that there is No Place for Me There. There's also the possibility to ignore the realization and go for Redemption Rejection, which is what Complete Monsters would always do. Sometimes these people were just working for someone who turned out to be doing horrible things. A common form is to Kick the Morality Pet and/or realize that Being Evil Sucks.
Common when The Dark Side Will Make You Forget ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSideWillMakeYouForget"] or when Big Brother Is Employing You.
Compare Nice Job Breaking It, Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero"] (when someone has good intentions but harmful execution), He Who Fights Monsters (when someone became a heel by doing a dirty job for too long), Then Let Me Be Evil (when they realise they're a heel — but they embrace it), Jerkass Realization, Regretful Traitor (when their realisation comes after a Face–Heel Turn), Guilt-Induced Nightmare, and Unwitting Pawn (when they've done bad things because someone was manipulating them). Contrast with Knight Templar who often never realize that they are a villain (though there are plenty of exceptions) and Card-Carrying Villain (who never thinks he's a good guy in the first place). Also see Tomato in the Mirror, when one of the good guys realizes he was a sleeper agent all the time.
Compare and contrast Evil Me Scares Me ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMeScaresMe"].
For the direct opposite, see Face Realization ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceRealization"]. Or for the other direct opposite, see Obliviously Evil. See also You Are Better Than You Think You Are for where the character fails to see they are nobler than they give themselves credit for.
