This is where the most beautiful member of a group — who just so happens to be Always Female ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale"] — wears a more revealing version of the standard uniform in order to ramp up the fanservice. This very often has little to do with the plot; the artist or costume designer is simply having fun dressing up the sexy one. Typically, the custom uniform will show more skin around the shoulders, cleavage, midriff or legs compared to the standard version. This often applies to The Vamp, even if other female characters in the group wear more standard clothing. If there's a Tomboy and Girly Girl dynamic in place, this serves as a fairly obvious visual cue. In extreme cases, this can get into what is usually Sexy Whatever Outfit territory.
A Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] of Rule of Sexy.
Despite this trope's name, it is more likely to be a Non-Uniform Uniform ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonUniformUniform"] than a flat-out Custom Uniform, meaning it will still have elements of the standard outfit while showing more skin.
