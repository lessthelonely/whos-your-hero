One of the Stock Superpowers ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockSuperpowersIndex"]; a person with Super Reflexes can react to situations faster than normal. This is typically used to allow him to dodge or cancel threats that would otherwise blindside a regular character.
Unlike Spider-Sense ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense"], there is normally no psychic component to this ability â€” rather, the character with Super Reflexes acquired the skill through training, Applied Phlebotinum, technological enhancement, or just dumb luck. An implied limitation is that a character with Super Reflexes must first notice the danger before he can (quickly) react to it, so some element of Super-Senses is implied. Whether or not this is enforced depends on the quality of the work.
Super Reflexes is often a Required Secondary Power ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers"] for Super-Speed, but the two are not equivalent; just because a character can dodge a flurry of lightning-fast fists doesn't mean he can run halfway across a field in the blink of an eye. Expect this power to be revoked the moment it becomes inconvenient for the plot; witness The Flash being able to clean an entire house in a tenth of a second one page and slam into a villain's outstretched arm on the next.
In non-superhero settings, Super Reflexes may be called other names like "Combat Reflexes" or "Heightened Response".
Bullet Time ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime"] is a visual effect often used to depict this trope.
Compare and contrast with Super-Speed ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed"] and Spider-Sense. May overlap with Dodge the Bullet.
