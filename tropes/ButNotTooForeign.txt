Foreign characters may pop up in fiction, but often regular characters who are not native (to the country the work is set in) tend to have native ethnicity somewhere in their family. Or possibly were born in the native country, but raised in another country, and have recently come back.
There are four variations of this trope:
Part of this probably stems from the actual ethnic homogeneity of a country, especially in Japan where foreigners really do make up only about two percent of the population. Their name will also have an obvious foreign sound to it even if it doesn't sound real. ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsLongAsItSoundsForeign"] Assuming this character was raised overseas, it's notable the character who is Not Too Foreign will rarely speak another language on-screen even if they are supposed to be fluent. This is often an artifact of a manga-to-anime transition: a text translation can be passable, while voice actors end up totally mangling it. How much an actor is allowed to speak tends to reflect more on their personal fluency. This in itself does often lead to Mukokuseki within anime and manga works and Ambiguously Brown at the opposite end of this trope.
Frequently, this trope is used as an excuse to give a character an unusual phenotype, especially in anime/manga which try to avoid the use of Anime Hair ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair"]. In reality, however, it is unlikely for a person who is, say, half-German, half-Japanese to have blue/green eyes or blond/red hair, given that the alleles for those traits are recessive.
In anime and manga, the non-Japanese ethnicity is often either German ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman"], "American" (usually white. If, and that's a very rare if, they're black, they will probably come from the US), British, or French (relying on people to think "He's British? Must be sophisticated and smart." or "He's French? How romantic!") The occasional Russian, either ex-military, mafia, or often both, will also pop up.
But Not Too Foreign often pops up as the result of creative types trying to appeal to the people of their homeland with the sense that they possess a connection to their culture despite being partly foreign, and are thus perfectly okay to empathize with. See also Non-Specifically Foreign ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSpecificallyForeign"].
Compare But Not Too Black ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack"] and Mixed Ancestry is Attractive â€” this trope greatly contributes to the latter, as mixed ancestry can give a character more unique features while not being totally alien to the target audience.
Some examples can be non-native, due to the thousands of races in the world, and we don't just marry people of the same race anymore, making this trope Truth in Television ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"] for the most part. Characters like these can sometimes have a Multi-Ethnic Name. May also overlap into Twofer Token Minority. Overlaps with Plays Great Ethnics in Real Life.
