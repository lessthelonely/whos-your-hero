    <hero:tropeDescription>Alice has never really been in love with anyone else but Bob. She can only be attracted to/aroused by him — not even other men, or, for that matter, women. Not even porn can do it for Alice unless Bob is in the porn. If Bob turns into a girl ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender"], Alice will still be hot for her. If Bob is technically more than one person, Alice will love all of them, to the exclusion of everyone else that does not inhabit Bob's body. The only way you can describe Alice's sexuality is "Bob-sexual". Sometimes a serious character type, sometimes a joke said by Charles to describe Alice's infatuation with Bob. Sometimes it gets to the point where Alice becomes a Stalker with a Crush ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush"] or something similar. Uninterest in attractive people of appropriate gender, other than one's love interest, is commonly shown as an indication of being deeply in love; whether this is Truth in Television ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"] varies between couples. Feeling this way about a partner is not as unusual for those on the grey portions of the asexual and/or aromantic spectrums, for example. Many shippers tend to believe their One True Pairing is affected by this. This trope is when someone's only attracted to one person at all. If the person is a sole exception to someone's normal sexual preferences, it's If It's You, It's Okay ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay"], being hetero- or homosexual plus one, rather than asexual plus one. See One True Love ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove"]. Not to be confused with Single Object Sexuality or Object Sexuality in general. If a breakup or even death ensues, may lead to them hooking up with a Replacement Goldfish or even the Doppelgänger Replacement Love Interest.
