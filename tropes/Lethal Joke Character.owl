    <hero:tropeDescription>You've just unlocked an absolutely useless Joke Character ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter"]. Weak attack, laughable specials, etc. And yet, your buddy next door uses them every time... and always kicks your ass. Are they Cherry Tapping ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping"]? Nope; the last time you won was when you put it on "random." They’ve discovered how to use the Lethal Joke Character. The designers, looking for balance, have sneaked in one obscure, impossible-to-master, but incredibly rewarding technique for this character, and using it, you'll win every time... if you can get it down. But doing so requires skill, practice, and the ability to see the potential in the seemingly-useless. It's a sort of Obfuscating Stupidity ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity"] applied to the game mechanics. Whether the character is actually considered good in the game's competitive scene can vary, as these characters are typically defined by a single powerful gimmick—sometimes, that gimmick is the only string to the character's bow, meaning they can struggle against a player who knows how to beat it, while other times, it ties together an otherwise unimpressive skillset and turns the character into a very real powerhouse. Quirky Bard ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyBard"] is a subtrope found in many role-playing games. Compare Elite Tweak, an in-game feature which takes a capable character and turns them into a wrecking monster. Difficult, but Awesome refers to characters whose potential is more obvious, but requires more effort to utilize. Unlike a Magikarp Power, the Lethal Joke Character always had this ability to kick ass; it just requires a lot of skill to use them. See Lethal Joke Item for useless inventory and skills that eventually become overpowered. Heart Is an Awesome Power is the non-gameplay version. Not to be confused with Fighting Clown ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingClown"], which is a silly character whose strength is readily-apparent (whereas here it isn't), or Mechanically Unusual Fighter / Mechanically Unusual Class, who/which is intended to be a viable option without resorting to an obscure tactic. As with Joke Character ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter"], this is a Game Trope. For non-game examples, see This Looks Like a Job for Aquaman, Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass, Beware the Silly Ones, or Heart Is an Awesome Power.</hero:tropeDescription>
