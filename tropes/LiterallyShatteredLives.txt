Someone gets frozen ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithIce"] or petrified, and is then smashed into itty-bitty pieces. A great way to make sure that someone is Deader than Dead and to make Harmless Freezing dangerous. In gaming, this generally falls under the Chunky Salsa Rule and guarantees instant death, although this could destroy their equipment as well.
However, it can occasionally be counteracted by the victim Pulling Themselves Together ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PullingThemselvesTogether"] or restoring themselves From a Single Cell. Alternately, depending on how souls, spirits, and immortality in general work, there may be nothing preventing them from taking control of another body somehow.
In real life, this wouldn't happen (at least with freezing). Fleshy creatures are held together by fibrous connective tissues and are pretty darn dense. When frozen solid, we don't break easily and definitely don't shatter. Drop a frozen corpse and it may crack, but it will definitely stay togetherâ€”if it doesn't just bounce. This trope is only possible in Real Life ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife"] with fruits, which tend to be much less fibrous than other living things. This is a serious case of Rule of Cool.
Since this is often a Death Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrope"], beware of spoilers.
