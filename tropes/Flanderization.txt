The act of taking a single (often minor) action or trait of a character within a work and exaggerating it more and more over time until it completely consumes the character. Most always, the trait/action becomes completely outlandish and it becomes their defining characteristic, turning them into a caricature of their former selves. Sitcoms ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sitcom"] and sitcom characters are particularly susceptible to this, as are peripheral characters in shows with long runs.
The trope is named for The Simpsons ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons"] character Ned Flanders, who was originally depicted as a friendly, generous Christian neighbor and a model father, husband and citizen, making him a contrast to Homer Simpson. As seasons progressed, however, he became increasingly obsessively religious to the point where he eventually embodied almost every negative stereotype of the God-fearing, bible-thumping American Christian evangelist.
Note that the key to this trope is in how the process is a gradual thing: the character starts relatively normal with a few quirks, the quirks become more prominent, then the quirks gradually become the character. If the character acquires quirks that are contrary to their earlier portrayal, usually because the writers were figuring out what to do with them, that is Characterization Marches On ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn"].
In general, comedies, especially sitcoms, fall into the trap of Flanderization because Character Development ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment"] is far less important than Rule of Funny. Given a choice between getting a laugh or moving the story forward, the former will almost always take priority.
Flanderization doesn't have to be a bad thing ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools"] â€” sometimes it can be used to expand on a background character's personality when they are brought to the foreground, or make an otherwise bland character stand out more. It can even be beneficial on a cast-wide scale: A comedy that has a cast full of zany, outsized personas will probably be funnier than one full of nondescript straight men.
When Flanderization occurs as the result of adaptation from one medium to another (manga to anime, for example), it's Character Exaggeration ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterExaggeration"] and frequently a sign of Adaptation Decay. May sometimes be related to Lost in Imitation.
See also Never Live It Down ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown"] (when the character is more associated with some action or event than the character actually changing), Unintentionally Sympathetic (when realistic quirks are mishandled by the writers) and Forgot Flanders Could Do That (when a story brings back pre-Flanderized aspects of the character as a reminder that those traits are there, even if you don't see them much any more). Compare Temporarily Exaggerated Trait, which is like flanderization but only done temporarily. Compare and contrast Early-Installment Weirdness (as it applies to characters), with early depictions of a character being different from later ones simply because the producers hadn't figured out what role they should play in the story. See also Moral Disambiguation for when the morality of a work becomes more black and white.
The opposite to this trope is Character Development ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment"], naturally.
