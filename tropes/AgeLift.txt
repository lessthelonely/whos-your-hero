An Age Lift is when the age of a character is modified for the sake of an adaptation. A young child is aged into a teenager, or an elderly individual is downscaled to just a middle-aged one. Often the exact age is not that important to the character so long as retains some relative qualities, if you're still living at home the difference between teen and pre-teen doesn't matter much. Among the exact reasons, this can simply be a case of the creators avoiding issues of a less than wholesome relationship or wanting to give two characters more of a connection by making them contemporaries (not necessarily a friendly one; it can be used to emphasise a Foil ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil"]). Or maybe the original age of the characters doesn't fit their target audience, and thus hoping for a Younger and Hipper or Hotter and Sexier vibe.
In live action, it can be a Pragmatic Adaptation ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation"] to take into account factors such as child labour laws and how demanding a role may be for a younger actor. It is also likely to occur if something happens to the character within the source material which makes keeping them at their original age problematic even with Dawson Casting, but, because the event in question is essential to the plot, leaving it out isn't an option either. If a story takes place over a decade it's typically easier to keep a consistent actor rather than recast three times. The two most common forms of this appear to be aging pre-teen characters to teenagers so twenty-somethings can feasibly play them and aging thirty-something parents by about a decade to counter the potential Values Dissonance relating to young parents.
Compare Artistic Age ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticAge"] (where the appearance is more important than the number of years), Dawson Casting (which leaves the age of the character the same but casts an older actor for the part anyway), Hollywood Old (which does likewise with younger actors), Underage Casting (same), Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome (where the character's age inexplicably changes in the original work itself) and Younger and Hipper. Vague Age is when the viewers and often the creators don't really know exactly how old a character is, and it's a great excuse for why the show might make a specific claim that seems like a change to some previously established fact. Seeing as age brings experience with it, this might also cause an Adaptational Skill.
Three-Month-Old Newborn ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthOldNewborn"] is a meta subtrope that results from the logistical issues of using actual newborns to play young babies.
