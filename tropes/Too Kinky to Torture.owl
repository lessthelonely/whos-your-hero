    <hero:tropeDescription>The best way to survive, nay, thrive during torture is to get off on it (we mean the victim, not the audience ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice"]). Whether it's masochism or a steel mind ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervesOfSteel"], nothing is more demoralizing to a torturer than their victim berating them on a sloppy job, or worse, giving them tips! Even bluffing enjoyment can work wonders when under torture, and we mean the good stuff ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique"], not just talkies. Note that this is not always Truth in Television ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"] for actual masochists, though they might develop a high pain tolerance or an uncanny ability to not react to pain. Most people who identify as masochists don't enjoy being hurt outside of a romantic/sexual context. Still, there are some who do. If one really wants to take it Up to Eleven ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope"], remember, it's a Good Thing You Can Heal. For extreme cases of this, try putting the torture victim in an And I Must Scream state and/or Go Mad from the Isolation. Bad Is Good and Good Is Bad might also do the trick. Also keep in mind that people can be irrationally annoyed by harmless and innocuous things like disrupted patterns, perpetual messes, certain smells, etc. Subtrope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subtrope"] of Torture Is Ineffective. Compare Power Dynamics Kink, Too Spicy for Yog-Sothoth, Aren't You Going to Ravish Me?, Deliberately Distressed Damsel, Combat Sadomasochist, Unishment, and last but not least Threat Backfire. Compare Briar Patching and Mischief for Punishment, when someone acts out on purpose because they want the punishment. A form of Attack Backfire ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackBackfire"]. No Real Life Examples, Please!
