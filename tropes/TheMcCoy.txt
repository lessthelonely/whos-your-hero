"By God, Jim ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKirk"]! You can't seriously be considering this! Screw the Prime Directive, there's no time for debate! We have to act now to rescue the High Priestess; forget the MacGuffin and think about doing what's right!
What's that, Spock ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock"]? 'Logic?' If we listened to your cold reasoning, you'd have us look for that stupid Cosmic Keystone while innocent people suffer! Especially since one of them could help us get it a whole lot faster!"
The McCoy is another part of the Freudian Trio ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianTrio"], along with The Kirk and The Spock. (Specifically, the Id.) Where the former is rational and intuitive, and the latter is cold and logical, the McCoy is emotional and humanistic. He cares about others deeply; for him doing the right thing is not a question of convenience or moral relativity, but about the concrete reality right now. Which is to say, someone like The Kirk cares about saving people; the McCoy cares about making things right. If the McCoy is placed in front of the To Be Lawful or Good choice, he will always choose the "Good" option in a heartbeat. He will eschew any and all attempts at engaging in careful deliberation and weighing of the options, and will even frequently openly disparage his allies if they try to do so; accusing them of wasting valuable time and resources sitting around on their hands and contemplating their navels instead of trying to save the people who are suffering and dying as they speak. This often leads the heroes into hot water as this concern for others blinds him to complications in the Moral Dilemma of the week and leads him to advocate (or take it upon himself to do) "the right thing", regardless of how disastrous it would be in the short or long run.
That said, they help keep the drama of a situation personal both for the characters and the viewer, reminding us just why the Littlest Cancer Patient ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlestCancerPatient"] deserves for The Hero to use the Applied Phlebotinum that only works once on him rather than to get them home. To be fair, the Spock can be just as compassionate but is tempered with detachment and enough forethought to realize that the right answer might not be the correct one, (illogical as that sounds). This makes them more willing to sacrifice a few people for many (or sacrifice themselves).
The McCoy is frequently a target for reminders about the Prime Directive ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause"]; one or more episodes might focus on how having his heart on his sleeve can actually cause quite a bit of damage to the people he "helps" with the best of intentions.
The McCoy still functions as an admirable character, however, due to his absolute devotion to his moral beliefs and his refusal to give in to what others may tell him. To him, there is no such thing as acceptable losses ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves"] (unless offset by a larger return fitting the loss). And if you start claiming that numbers can be lost or that A Million Is a Statistic, you can expect a thorough chewing out for your coldness. In the McCoy's mind, every life matters and everyone deserves to be saved. While The Spock sees people as numbers in the greater picture, The McCoy sees people with real lives and emotions. Not that he's unwilling to listen to The Spock; the McCoy does know the value of logic despite himself, but he will be clear that even The Spock's plan will be worthless if the wrong person dies.
Also, the McCoy exists as a counterpart to The Spock ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpock"]. If they are the moral center of the team in general too, then they are The Heart as well. Likely to be the Red Oni in a Red Oni, Blue Oni combination. Closely related to the McCoy are Hot-Blooded and Agent Mulder. Probably sides with the Romanticists in Romanticism Versus Enlightenment.
The McCoy is Honor Before Reason ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason"] and Beware the Honest Ones personified, and may occasionally be a Strawman Emotional. Will sometimes use Save This Person, Save the World and / or I'm a Doctor, Not a Placeholder.
