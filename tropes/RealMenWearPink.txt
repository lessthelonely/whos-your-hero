For some reason, gritty loners, hulking brutes, and all around Manly Men ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyMan"] tend to gravitate towards at least one decidedly un-manly interest or hobby. Usually, it involves baking, sewing, or the color pink. While oftentimes this hobby is kept under wraps alongside the Embarrassing Middle Name, Mr. Badass quite often shamelessly enjoys it. Even more often, it's just one of those things you never bothered to ask about. Plus, apparently he was never instilled with the Pink Girl, Blue Boy archetype when he was growing up. Or maybe he was, and couldn't be bothered with it anyway. It's a safe assumption that he cares very deeply for his mother. And in other words, he is a Manly Man with a Sensitive Guy Streak!
The basis is that someone who's self-evidently "masculine" ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyMan"] doesn't need to demonstrate his masculinity in the stereotypical ways. If the Manly Man sees something as manly then it will become manly as he himself is the definition of manly, kind of like how celebrities tend to change fashion in Real Life. Then some men just like to use this as a practical reason to start fights or enjoy the fact that no one will dare to mock him. (Would you?)
Note that if the cultural norms are different in the work's setting (such as fantasy, a period piece, or a work made in Asia) that is not this trope. If all the men are wearing skirts, or pink is a frequent color for masculine costumes or if many men are weavers: that's just a cultural difference. This trope only applies to individuals or a small group of connected characters (such as a family, religious order etc). It also only applies if the work specifically codes the activity or thing as feminine.
This trope doesn't work on extremely feminine looking Bish≈çnen ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen"] or Gender Benders, as it's about manly men. If a character has enough girlish traits or hobbies that it starts to compromise his manliness, especially if they have an effeminate appearance, then the character may be In Touch with His Feminine Side. If he looks macho but never acts it he's just a Gentle Giant.
A primary character trait of the Cultured Badass ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturedBadass"] and some House Husbands.
Compare Less Embarrassing Term ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LessEmbarrassingTerm"], Princesses Prefer Pink, Emotional Bruiser, Real Men Love Jesus, Agent Peacock, Gay Bravado, Camp Straight, Purple Is Powerful (when people think just Graceful Ladies Like Purple) and Girly Girl with a Tomboy Streak (this trope's distaff counterpart). Liable to overlap with Papa Wolf if the 'pink' in question is a loving nature. A common form of this is Briefs Boasting. Pink Is Erotic can come into play when the man is a lady killer and highly skilled in the art of seduction. Psycho Pink can also play if a man is psychotic and uses uncontrollable violence.
Contrast Sissy Villain ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SissyVillain"], Pink Is for Sissies.
If someone has these sort of characteristics, but is trying to hide them, then they may have an Unmanly Secret ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnmanlySecret"].
