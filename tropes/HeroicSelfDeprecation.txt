You'd think that saving the world — especially on a semi-regular basis, as some heroes do — would give your sense of self-worth a bit of a boost, if not cause some serious ego issues. The parades and statues in your honor, the best-selling biography by your most ardent fan (Monster Slaying and Other Handy Household Hints), the town hall getting renamed after you... Surely you don't need anyone else to tell you how special you are.
Well, not if the hero who engages in Heroic Self-Deprecation is anything to go by.
No matter how much they do for the world or what their loyal friends ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions"] tell them, this hero is still incapable of believing that they're anything more than useless. Every little mistake leads to a massive display about how it's all their fault and how they're just not good enough. Praise may lead only to Dismissing a Compliment. They're trying to be a Humble Hero, but they're going too far. Sometimes, going way too far.
It doesn't matter how many lives they've saved, worlds they've rescued, or bad guys they've defeated — their self-esteem remains in negative figures, and they'll still have a periodic Heroic BSoD ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD"], rendered useless until someone can snap them out of it by telling them they're wonderful. And someone will. Because for every hero with terrible self-esteem, there's a group of True Companions on standby to give them encouraging words and speeches, usually with at least one Get a Hold of Yourself, Man!. Magical Girls especially are prone to giving speeches of thanks after this happens: she repays her squad by crediting her success to the supportive words of her friends and love interest.
While not always a bad thing ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools"], this can get rather irritating if done too often or to an extreme degree, especially if the hero's exploits are so grandiose that nobody could fail to realize that they are A Very Important Person. Sometimes writers feel they're in a bind; wanting their hero to be modest but also wanting the audience to realize they're amazing. So they have the hero put themselves down incessantly to avoid bragging while having the Greek Chorus of their friends reminding us that just because they don't brag about it doesn't mean that they're not the best thing since sliced bread. This unfortunately breaks the Show, Don't Tell rule, which doesn't sit well with people. Especially if this trope is done so badly it veers into Wangst territory. However, this trope is quite more common in cynical settings, since bragging a character's heroic deeds can be considered Too Good for This Sinful Earth.
In Ancient Greece ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece"] the opposite was true; a real hero acknowledged his triumphs and was expected to boast about anything he had really done. As long as you avoided hubris, this was fine; it showed generosity of spirit.
While this trope tends to be associated with female characters, there are enough male examples so that it is not Always Female ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale"]. Children and teenagers can be prone to this if they're thrown in at the deep end early in life, but young boys are more likely to be given a storyline where they get big-headed and have to be brought down to earth. Adult males are not immune, either; while bragging might be seen as less of a sin for men, and reversing it as less necessary, there will still be a few authors who use modesty as a virtue and go a bit too far.
Contrast Think Nothing of It ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkNothingOfIt"], which is reasonable self-deprecation, and Dude, Where's My Respect?, where a character with a lot of accomplishments is belittled by other people instead of by themself. If this mood is just a one-off thing for a character, then it is You Are Better Than You Think You Are. Contrast also Inferiority Superiority Complex (for someone who acts tough but is revealed to have low self-esteem beneath all that), as well as pure Superiority Complexes: Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy, Insufferable Genius, Smug Super, and Knight Templar.
Very much Truth in Television ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"]. Many great leaders and thinkers have suffered from depression, resulting in this exact symptom.
Not to be confused with Self-Deprecation ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation"], which is just cracking jokes. See also "The Reason You Suck" Speech, Driven by Envy.
