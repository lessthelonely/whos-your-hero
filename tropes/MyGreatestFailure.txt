Nothing defines a hero better than his morals, and the biggest sympathy point can be guilt over some monumental screw-up that taught the hero to buckle down and stop taking his job too lightly. This is sometimes related to the origin of a Superhero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero"], but has more impact when the hero's career has otherwise been going well for a while.
From a philosophical standpoint, this makes sense â€” if someone wins all the time, as heroes tend to do ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodGuysAlwaysWin"], they would be more defined by their failures than their successes. In Marvel Comics, this is sometimes a consistent psychological flaw (the "Marvel Flaw") which occasionally prevents a hero from succeeding.
The hero will often declare "It's All My Fault ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault"]" while their friends and family say "You Did Everything You Could."
The hero may recover from this and when they do, it's usually a sign they have grown ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment"], although retcons can cause an unpleasant return to status quo.
The Failure Knight ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureKnight"] has this as part of his backstory to explain why he is so devoted to his new charge. Often produces a combination of Past Experience Nightmares and Anxiety Dreams.
See I Let Gwen Stacy Die ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetGwenStacyDie"] for one of the most common failures. Might result in We Used to Be Friends. Often happens to heroes who fail to make amends. Can be a Career-Building Blunder. When the failure is what put the character on the path to being the current (better) person s/he is now, it's Necessary Fail. If the plot brings about an opportunity to correct or make up for their failure, you have My Greatest Second Chance. If failure puts the hero in a funk that takes years to shake off then you have a Scrap Heap Hero. Also compare to Old Shame, which is often what drives this mindset.
