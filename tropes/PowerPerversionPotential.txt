Superhuman powers are a great way to fight for truth, justice, and the American Way. For the more inventive, they're also a great way to add some extra fun to sexy times. It could give them an extra edge in pleasing their partners, improve their chances at romance, provide different ways to explore their own pleasure, or even, for morally lacking individuals, as a tool for vouyerism, molestation, or even flat-out rape ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil"], either by force or manipulation. If any sort of superpowered or supernatural ability gets used for something sexual, it's this trope.
Mind Control ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl"], Psychic Powers (Synchronization in particular), invisibility, intangibility, sprouting tentacles, X-Ray Vision, and the ability to stop (or otherwise manipulate) time are especially vulnerable to this. Shapeshifting Squick is a related sub-trope. Fantastic Arousal is when this trope meets unusual body parts.
See Mundane Utility ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility"] for less perverted applications of superpowers and gadgets. See Video Game Perversity Potential for this trope applied to the creativity of Game Mods. If the use of powers during sex comes with risks to one or both partners, it is Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex. Remember that this is the kind of perversion related to sexual matters, not the sort that would suggest such things as Superpowered Evil Side or Video Game Cruelty Potential.
