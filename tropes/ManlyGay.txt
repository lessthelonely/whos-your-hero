Sitting on the opposite end of the spectrum from Camp Gay ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay"], Manly Gay is when a homosexual man is shown not only in lacking Camp or feminine traits, but kept going in the opposite direction and into the realm of pure, unbridled masculinity.
A character who is Manly Gay is the complete opposite of the Camp ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp"] stereotype. Typically such characters are large and strong and shown doing masculine things like sports. He may have a Carpet of Virility, he may be a badass, or he may have Stout Strength...but regardless of how he got here, the result is the same: He's manlier than your average man, straight or otherwise.
This is an archetype associated with modern gay porn, but it's also a distilled ideal of gay male culture having roots in Greek philosophy about male sexuality, one that often appeals to other gay men â€” one of the reasons it has become so associated with gay porn. Such characters also appear in other works as a means of telling a Gay Aesop ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayAesop"] about how not all gay people are 'like that'. Manly Gay characters are often seen as a form of Straight Gay by straight (especially Western) audiences, while it's seen as its own gay stereotype to others (especially Eastern audiences and gay folks themselves).
Compare and contrast with Straight Gay ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay"]. The Distaff Counterpart is a Lipstick Lesbian. If the character is stereotypically Camp, then he's actually Macho Camp, a trope many Played for Laughs examples also fall into. May be The Bear, a Big Beautiful Man, a Leather Man or a Gay Cowboy. Many a Gayngster qualifies. May also be an Armored Closet Gay. See also Bara Genre, the genre where Manly Gay men have... fun with one another.
