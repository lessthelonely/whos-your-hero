You might be ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingRelic"] the Last of Your Kind, or someone else made a Heroic Sacrifice for you, or you lived through a Restricted Rescue Operation, but whatever the reason, you're going to feel a massive sense of guilt. An easy way to generate Angst. Practically a guarantee in cases of Death by Childbirth, or when one is a Sole Survivor.
If you hear a surviving character utter a phrase along the lines of "It should have been ME!", you know this trope is full force. This trope is all but guaranteed if a character that was Too Cool to Live ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooCoolToLive"] sacrifices themselves to save others. The surviving characters will deem themselves responsible for the awesome ally having to make a Heroic Sacrifice and not being capable enough to handle themselves.
Can also lead to the victim becoming a Death Seeker ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker"] or Failure Knight. May cause Past Experience Nightmares, Drowning My Sorrows, and various other ways to cope, while trusted friends and/or professionals plead with him to realize that he has nothing to beat himself up about. Contrast You Should Have Died Instead, where a character tries to evoke Survivor Guilt in another or spitefully rub it in. Sometimes (although not always), Who Wants to Live Forever? is an extreme case where an immortal character among a mortal community feels this.
Truth in Television ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision"]: Survivor's Guilt is a common symptom of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, especially among suicide witnesses and soldiers coming back from war.
