While pajamas or underwear are the most commonly depicted garments worn for sleep, it's also not uncommon to depict a person wearing nothing to bed at all. ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin"] While this is Truth in Television, media often treat this as shocking or exotic, with the character who does it being portrayed as an oddball for doing so, and they're often comically opinionated about the superiority of their sleeping habit if questioned, often mentioning health or comfort benefits.
Sometimes used to illustrate the setting, such as a depiction of a period before sleepwear became mainstream, or character, as in showing a person prefers not to wear clothes ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNudityTaboo"] at home at all or has other traits to them that make sleepwear either unnecessary or in some way a hindrance. Sometimes the characters simply don't have any clothes to spare, and sleeping without clothes is a sign of a dire situation or even poverty, similar to a Bankruptcy Barrel. And sometimes they sleep nude because they live in a very warm environment and would find extra insulation (in the form of pajamas) to be unnecessary.
Naturally, it also serves as a form of Fanservice ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice"], with the notion that nude sleepers are tied to seductive or sex-positive characters, with The Tease oversharing that she does it just to titillate others. Fan Disservice is also just as likely, with the common stereotype that old, ugly, or gross people also enjoy sleeping naked. As such nude sleepers are commonly either portrayed as very attractive or very repulsive.
A lot of awkwardness may happen if a character sleeps this way have to share a bed but There Is Only One Bed ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsOnlyOneBed"]. A Shameless Fanservice Girl or someone with No Sense of Personal Space may not mind, but the other person surely will. Expect a Bedmate Reveal if someone who sleeps naked sneaks into another character's bed, intentionally or accidentally, with one of them usually freaking out and jumping to conclusions. A Modesty Bedsheet (or a woman lying on her front) can be employed if censorship is necessary.
When someone is woken up abruptly while in this state, it can also be an example of Naked People Are Funny ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny"] or an Inconvenient Summons. Can sometimes lead to Dining in the Buff if someone chooses to get a Midnight Snack or make breakfast without getting dressed, or a Full-Frontal Assault if attacked in their sleep.
