This is a character who is primarily, or even only, known by their In-Series Nickname ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSeriesNickname"].
Related to ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SisterTrope"] Everyone Calls Him "Barkeep", but that is about people being referred to exclusively by their jobs or what they're best known for doing. Also related to Stage Names. Does not include Fan Nicknames, secret identities or explicit pseudonyms. Also doesn't include people who give themselves new names following an act of self-reinvention, and stop responding to their old name (e.g. Voldemort). Exceptionally badass examples of this trope fall into the Red Baron. Obvious and common contractions, e.g. people named William introducing themselves as Bill, don't really count either.
Usually, Dramatis Personae ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramatisPersonae"] will give the full name of such a character first, though the actual script will use the nickname almost exclusively even in the unspoken directions.
If the character insists on the nickname, it's Do Not Call Me "Paul" ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotCallMePaul"]. If the nickname is actually his real name, it's His Name Really Is "Barkeep".
