This trope is when a celebrity, Super Hero ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero"] with a Secret Identity, a magical, non-human creature, etc. is mistaken for an impersonation of themselves, and furthermore, criticized or laughed at for their lame "costume".
Picture this: Elvis ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley"] really is Not Quite Dead after all. He decides to surprise the world by showing up at one of those Elvis ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley"] Impersonator conventions in full iconic Elvis ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley"] regalia. What does he hear when he shows up? His outfit is the poorest recreation anyone has ever seen, his accent sounds totally fake, his hair style is all wrong, and he's much too tall. Nice try, newbie, but you would never pass as the real Elvis ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley"].
May be evoked in Clark Kenting ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting"]. Yes, this does happen in Real Life because Reality Is Unrealistic. Also, performers who are going to work have cosmetics and costume people to get them ready to look good under the bright lights, compared to whatever day-to-day clothes they wear to go shopping.
A contributing factor is that impersonations are usually not judged on how much they look and act like the real celebrity in general, but how faithfully they can recreate a small number of recorded performances ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools"]. Those same recordings are available for the impersonator to rehearse with again and again, whereas for the real Elvis, that performance was only one out of hundreds in his career. Many of the small details in the canonical recording that the impersonators lovingly reproduce would be unimportant accidents to the real performer, or at best just one point on an entire scale of ways they can perform.
Not to be confused with ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant"] Cheap Costume or Beta Outfit. Also see Recognition Failure, Mistaken for Clown and Genuine Imposter. This might lead to the "impersonator" explaining that Actually, I Am Him.
