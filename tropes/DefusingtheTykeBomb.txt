Tykebombs ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb"] are generally raised with people who tell them they're nothing but a weapon and usually treat them like crap. Then along comes someone who's different. When they look at the Tykebomb, they don't see a weapon, they see a messed-up little kid. Naturally, they try to rescue the poor Tykebomb, talking or fighting their way towards them. Hug Tropes are likely to comprise their arsenal; also expect The Power of Friendship to be used. The one doing the defusing is also likely to be a Warrior Therapist and/or an All-Loving Hero.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't; what matters for trope purposes is the intent. Compare Because You Were Nice to Me ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe"].
See I Am Not a Gun ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotAGun"], when the Tyke-Bomb defuses themselves.
