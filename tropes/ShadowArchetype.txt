Shadow Archetype has to do with two elements of writing: characters and settings. In this article we discuss character archetypes. For the settings viewpoint, see Shadowland ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shadowland"].
Character-wise, it's the part of the personality that embodies everything a character, called the 'Self', doesn't like about themselves, the things they (often subconsciously) deny about themselves ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheMask"] and project on to others. In fact, the more the Shadow has been repressed, the more powerful it becomes. To show these things to the audience we need an embodiment of some sort.
Around here, we call some of those embodiments things like:
Those tropes have examples listed of characters playing those more-precise Shadow roles that often overlap with this but do not have to.
A common trope involves the Self accepting their Shadow, metaphorically coming to terms with their flaw (see I Am What I Am ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmWhatIAm"]). That is, The Hero refuses to kill the Shadow, given the opportunity, or outright refuses to fight it. In Enemy Within, Enemy Without, and Evil Twin situations, the Self and Shadow sometimes even merge towards the end for an endgame powerup, further emphasizing the symbolism.
Note that in Jungian psychology, the Shadow Archetype includes positive as well as negative things ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre"], anything suppressed or denied in the personality. Compare and contrast Foil and Mirror Character which highlight traits a character has or lacks.
