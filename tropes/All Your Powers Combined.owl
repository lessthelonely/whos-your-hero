    <hero:tropeDescription>Someone who has All Your Powers Combined is a character who has the complete powers of an entire group of people and can use them all simultaneously. Often this character is a villain who specializes in fighting a particular group of heroes, allowing them to pose a serious threat despite being outnumbered. The character often also has an Achilles' Heel ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel"] regarding the use of the power that keeps them from being completely unbeatable. Also commonly given to a villain who has acquired the powers of lesser villains. This is a good way to make a climactic Final Boss battle in a video game. Yet another variation for the heroes is when they transfer all their powers into a single member as a last resort, the idea being that consolidating all their power into one member being gives them a sufficient power boost to handle the villain that was too much for the team. Often a Dangerous Forbidden Technique ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique"]. In videogames, it's sometimes an Infinity +1 Sword equivalent, some final upgrade, form, class, or the like that combines the powers of all previous options at once. An increasingly common variation seen in Toku ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Toku"] franchises is to have this particular character be the end result of a fusion between two or more heroes, or a singular hero utilising the powers of others in their franchise to take on a new form. This can often be seen as crossing the Godzilla Threshold, as its use normally requires a significantly stronger threat than usual for the hero to face - this can even be another character who's an example of this trope, usually in the form of a Kaiju, Seijin or Kaijin using a similar technique, or one who's a chimera composed of previously fought foes. This is often the result of winning the Superpower Lottery ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery"]. Compare with Power Copying, Power Parasite, Keystone Superpower and Ditto Fighter, which can lead to this trope when someone can copy everyone's power and use them all at once. See also Adaptive Ability, for villains who constantly grow stronger; such a character is likely to engage in Ability Mixing, in which multiple powers are used in conjunction or simultaneously with each other to produce something unique to the setting. Contrast with Set Bonus. A Sub-Trope ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope"] of Combo Platter Powers, and a supertrope to Yin-Yang Bomb and "With Our Swords" Scene. When the characters are powerless until they combine, that's Wonder Twin Powers. Not to be confused with (though can be compared to) All Your Colors Combined, where rather than one character combining the powers of others, a group of characters collectively combines powers to attack. Not the same as Together We Are X, but could overlap.</hero:tropeDescription>
