Emma Grace Frost is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, most commonly in association with the X-Men. The character first appeared in The Uncanny X-Men #129 (Jan. 1980), and was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist/co-writer John Byrne. Emma Frost, also known as the White Queen, has evolved from a supervillain and foe of the X-Men, to becoming a superhero, one of the X-Men's most central members and leaders. Frost belongs to a subspecies of humanity called mutants, born with superhuman abilities. She is an urbane telepath with a well-noted dry wit. Emma Frost has been described as one of Marvel's most notable and powerful female heroes, being labelled as a femme fatale. The character appears in many adaptations of the X-Men properties, such as video games, animated programs, and she is portrayed by Tahyna Tozzi in the live-action film X-Men Origins: Wolverine (as Emma Frost Silverfox), and by January Jones in X-Men: First Class.
