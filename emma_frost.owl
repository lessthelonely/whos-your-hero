  <hero:evolution rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma Frost has transitioned from one of the X-Men's deadliest foes into a central figure on the side of the mutants. Her first era presented her as a leader in the Hellfire Club, but this ended when the manic time traveler Fitzroy appeared from the future, resulting in the deaths of many of her Hellions and putting Emma into a coma. Her involvement in the Phalanx Covenant arc led her to become co-teacher of the new Generation X team with Banshee. Later, after the end of the Generation X series, when the Sentinels devastated Genosha she gained a new power - her diamond form. Subsequent story arcs made her Cyclops' new partner and lover, and a former co-leader of the X-Men. She continues to play a prominent role in Cyclops' teams.</hero:evolution>

  <hero:alternateVersions rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma Frost of the Ultimate universe is a former student of Charles Xavier. Xavier and Frost became romantically involved while Xavier was still in a relationship with Mystique, causing Mystique to angrily lash out at Xavier in a grotesque form until Emma had to diamond-punch her. Emma was even responsible for the naming of Xavier's cat, saying it should be named Mystique when it destroyed his office in a similar manner to the actual Mystique. Emma and Charles, however, didn't make it as a couple. Frost leaves Xavier for mostly ideological differences as she thinks his approach to the mutant/human relation was too violent. Frost is more passive towards working on the mutant/human relation then Xavier. Frost goes back to Chicago and becomes a teacher giving mutant education seminars. The governor is very supportive of Frost's idea and helped introduce her to the White House chief of staff and eventually met the President.They come up with the New Mutants which is supposed to help educate humans about mutants while cutting ties with Xavies. During a press conference, Emma, the New Mutants, and even the President are attacked by Sentinels. Xavier and the X-Men came to help them. Xavier tried to convince Emma to come back to the school but she declined and returned to Chicago. In Chicago, she creates a new program called Academy of Tomorrow (the X-Men-like squad of the school being the Ultimate version of the New Mutants). She was later shown to be dating Shinobi Shaw (son of the deceased leader of the club, Sebastian Shaw). After Shinobi is arrested for attacking Jean Grey in order to release the Phoenix Force she was revealed to be the White Queen of this universe's Hellfire Club (wearing an outfit highly similar to her mainstream counterpart's White Queen garb) and requesting a new boyfriend. During the Ultimatum event, she is later confirmed dead by Madrox in issue #3.This version of Emma dresses more modestly and professionally than her mainstream counterpart, with even her initial outfit similar to her mainstream counterpart's White Queen costume showing very little skin. It is only when she is revealed as the White Queen that she wears the more revealing attire recognizable by her alternate counterpart. She also wore glasses most of the time (including as the White Queen).

  <hero:alternateVersions rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma leads the X-Society along with Cyclops. Wolverine and Beast. The team investigates occurrences in New Albion (which is known as California). Emma also refused Cyclops proposals stating her desire to avoid the "tedious scandal" so it would not cause any issues between the two of them. After a misunderstanding for being blamed for the deaths of the passengers in Hindenburg Disaster, the government placed the X-Society under house arrest so Emma migrated to Europe and was married to Cyclops. She later reappeared as Emmeline Frost-Summers, having married Cyclops, in the "Exaltation" storyline in "Astonishing X-Men", when Scott Summers from Earth-616 had been kidnapped by an alternate version of Charles Xavier known as "Savior". The world that this Xavier lived in was literally breaking apart, and only the power of Scott's optic beams were able to hold it together. However the price of this was the ultimate sacrifice: death. So Savior abducted the Scott Summers of various alternate Earths sacrificing them against their will to maintain his own world. Earth-616 Scott broke Emmeline out of her prison, and along with alternate versions of Storm, Nightcrawler, and Wolverine (known as Howlett only), they attempted to stop Savior. Reinforcements soon arrived in the form of Earth-616's Emma Frost and Ororo Munroe, who fought beside their alternate Earth counterparts. Emma helped Emmeline up and the two launched a telepathic assault against Savior. Once Savior had been stopped, Emmeline and the other aforementioned members of Scott's crew decided to remain there and band together to save that Earth. Emmeline revealed that the Scott she married - the Scott of Earth-889 - had suffered the fate Savior intended. He had died holding the world together with the energy of his optic beams. This makeshift new team would later become ... the X-Treme X-Men! Kurt Waggoner of the United States of California, General Howlett of the Dominion of Canada, and Emmeline Frost-Summers of the New Albion X-Society would soon be joined by Earth-616's Alison Blaire, aka Dazzler. They would embark on a journey to save different realities. The only way they could do this was by killing the evil Charles Xaviers in each reality. In first reality they traveled to, they stumbled immediately into the Pantheon of the Gods: Namor, god of the sea, Thor, god of thunder, Sabretooth, god of the wild, Warran, god of the air and sky, Draka, god of ice and snow, and Storm, the All-Mother. Emmeline bows to the gods so as not to incur their wrath. Alison has a problem doing so. After a brief battle with the gods, Xavier and Magnus arrive to whisk the team away to their version of Utopia. Emmeline and the head of Xavier, however, remain as telepathic servants to the gods. The X-treme X-Men return along with Magnus and Xavier only to find that the Xavier they thought was good was really manipulating the gods into killing mortals. The X-treme X-Men saved and freed the gods. In return for their favor, the All-Mother Storm offered them godhood. Emmeline decided to accept the offer, and the All-Mother began the transformation process. Emmeline notes that the one thing she had that was a weakness was her heart (emotion). The process of granting her godhood had removed that one weakness, and in the process, Emmeline's flesh turned to flawless diamond. Emmeline became the Diamond Queen, goddess of perfection and the mind.</hero:alternateVersions>

She and her mutant students, the Hellions would encounter the X-Men many times after this.Emma also plotted with Sebastian Shaw to kill Selene during her time as White Queen, as Sebastian Shaw saw Selene as a threat to his power. Emma was in charge of training a young mutant with great power named Firestar, who was meant to kill Selene, but Firestar inevitably found out about Emma and Shaw's true intentions and turned on them.At some point, Emma decided that she wanted more students, and approached Erik Magnus aka Magneto to get him to transfer his students to her academy. The White Queen snuck into Magneto's office and surprised him while he was pouring himself a drink. Magneto questions her, asking her why she had come to see him, and she tells him that her intentions are not hostile, as if they were he would be dead. Magneto tells her that he will never transfer his students, so Emma used her telepathy to influence Magneto and force him to do so.Her time with the Hellfire Club ends when she is attacked by a mad time traveler named Trevor Fitzroy.

The attack wiped out the population of the island. Jean Grey and Hank McCoy traveled to Genosha to help with relief efforts and discovered only one survivor - Emma Frost.

One of them broke Emma's nose. She shifted into diamond form, unable to telepathically shut them down because she was being blocked by the captive Martha Johansson who would go on to become No-Girl. Emma and Scott were detained. The U-Men were given orders to sever Scott's head from his body. They were to later turn their attention to Emma to take her apart and make some sort of human chandelier out of her. While they were occupied with Scott, Emma broke free of her restraints and angrily took down her opponents, freeing Scott in the process. They located Sublime once again in his office. Emma telepathically stimulated the man's pain receptors so that he could feel what she felt when her nose was broken but amplified to an unbearable degree.

Scott urged her not to, reminding her that X-Men don't kill. Sublime let go of Emma, falling to his death. Emma told Scott not to blame her as "he practically somersaulted" from her grip.Cassandra Nova had been using her influence in the Shi'ar Empire to return to Earth with a host of Shi'ar destroyers. It was revealed that she had unleashed thousands of nano sentinels into the air at the Xavier Institute, infecting the X-Men. She then lied to the Superguardians, telling them that this mutant plague was contagious and needed to be wiped out before it harmed everyone else in the galaxy. The Shi'ar Imperial Guard attacked the Institute. Emma was taken out first so that her formidable telepathic powers would not interfere with their invasion. A device was placed on her head that prevented her from using her powers. As the Superguardians battled their way into the school, Emma was stuck, powerless on the campus. Fortunately for her, the Stepford Cuckoos were able to psychically learn how to unlock the device. They helped Emma out of her constraints, and she headed back to the mansion, where an understanding between the X-Men and the Imperial Guard had been reached. Unfortunately, Cassandra Nova did not halt her attack, still using Xavier's body. All hope seemed lost until Emma returned and tricked Nova into making a deal with her. Emma would provide Nova with a host body if Nova let her live. Nova agreed and entered the body of the alien, Stuff, who was a gelatinous blob programmed for learning basic things, meaning Nova would be trapped in the body of an unintelligent, incompetent alien blob.</hero:storyDescription>

Cyclops engaged the Omega Gang, easily taking down several members. A member known as Tattoo phased her hand through Scott's head, threatening to solidify, thereby killing him. Emma slid her diamond hand through Tattoo's own head, saying that if Tattoo solidified, she would die as well. She was able to eliminate Tattoo as a threat. Meanwhile, the Stepford Cuckoos used the powers of their hive mind while Sophie Cuckoo used the drug known as Kick and Cerebra to enhance their powers. Together they were able to subdue Quentin but at a price. Emma had gone to check on Sophie. She carried the girl's dead body to the outside of the school. The psychic strain had killed Sophie Cuckoo.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">As Jean Grey was returning on a flight back to Westchester from her European missions with new mutant Sooraya Qadir, aka Dust, the Stepford Cuckoos contacted her, informing her that her husband, Scott, had been having a psychic affair with Emma Frost. The Cuckoos were mad that under Emma's tutelage, Sophie had decided to play the hero and died for it. This was their way of getting revenge. Scott and Emma were in the middle of their psychic tryst when Jean Grey returned, and burst into Emma's thoughts, catching them in the act. Scott tries to explain, but Jean shuts him out and gets personal with Emma. She forces her way into Emma's mind, and they argue, while Jean explores the depths of Emma's psyche, looking for memories Emma has been keeping well hidden. After invading Emma's mind and stomping around in it, Jean leaves, and Emma falls into Wolverine's arms, admitting finally and lamenting that she has fallen in love with Scott Summers. Beast goes to check on her later on, only to discover, to his shock and dismay, that Emma has been shot and shattered into thousands of little diamond shards. Veteran X-Men Lucas Bishop and Sage arrive on the scene to investigate Emma Frost's murder. They lock down the school and begin questioning everyone. It is later revealed that Angel Salvadore had confronted Emma Frost and shot her in her nose (the flawed weak point of her diamond form), thereby shattering her. Just before this diamond bullet was fired, Emma realized that Esme Cuckoo had been controlling Angel and had forced her to shoot Emma. Hank McCoy busied himself with reassembling Emma's diamond form in his lab as if it were a giant puzzle. When he was nearing completion, Jean decided to step in and used her Phoenix powers to piece Emma back together and fuse all the shards. Emma was alive again, and the first thing she did was shout out the name of Esme. Bishop and Sage confronted Esme as she was attempting to escape the school. She easily defeated them telepathically and then left the premises in a cab. It was revealed that Esme had been dealing the drug Kick at the school, and had gotten rid of Emma because she had been investigating it. Sooner or later, she would have discovered that Esme was behind it all. Esme had been using Kick to enhance her telepathy so that she could take total control of the hive mind she shared with the other Stepford Cuckoos. Sophie attempted to fight back, and because of that, Esme influenced Sophie's brash heroism during the riot at the school, thereby steering Sophie to her death. It was not Emma's fault, after all.</hero:storyDescription>

Once "reawakened", Emma was able to use her telepathy to restore the memories of others, thereby "reawakening" them as well. After a significant number of heroes, both X-Men and Avengers, had their memories restored, a meeting was held to discuss what should be done regarding the Scarlet Witch. Speaking to this issue, Emma said, "What is there to say? Put her down". Emma was the only one who agreed with Logan - the Scarlet Witch needed to be killed. A large group of X-Men and Avengers traveled to Genosha to deal with the Scarlet Witch. Wanda was driven to the edge, and in this final moment of madness, she uttered the words "No more mutants" deactivating the x-gene of mutants all over the world, thereby significantly decreasing the mutant population from hundreds of thousands to mere hundreds. Emma had been monitoring the battle via Cerebro, and upon the utterance of those words, Emma witnessed thousands of lights representing mutants suddenly go out.

They searched for survivors as they looked upon the carnage that the Marauders and the Purifiers had left in their wake. Emma used her telepathy to scan for survivors. The baby Hope was missing, and the X-Men believed Mr. Sinister's Marauders had taken her. In an effort to find her, a team of five - Wolverine, Storm, Nightcrawler, Colossus, &amp; Angel - was dispatched to confront the Marauders. Sinister, believing that taking down the team would be simple, was surprised to find that there was a sixth X-Man with them: though her body was back at the mansion, Emma was psychically present, shielding the minds of the X-Men against Sinister's telepathy. When the Sentinels that stood guard over the school were hijacked by Bishop (unbeknownst to the team), Emma's concentration was broken, and the team became susceptible to Sinister's attacks. Emma was also with the team later on when they battled the Marauders and took down Harpoon. During the battle on Muir Island, Emma psychically engaged Exodus, and the two battled telepathically. Though Exodus was capable of other feats (telekinesis, etc.), Emma was able to keep him so completely focused on their psi-battle that he was unable to use his other abilities on her. While Emma kept him distracted, Dust entered his body one grain of sand at a time, and scoured his lungs, incapacitating the mutant, while the rest of the X-Men finished off the remaining Marauders.</hero:storyDescription>

According to Scott's plan, Logan's healing factor was temporarily negated and he turned into a vampire as well. Emma suggested finding the deceased Dracula, and reanimating him so that he might take down Xarus for them. Namor retrieved Dracula's head and Storm and Gambit were dispatched to find the body. Once put back together, Dracula threatened to simply attack Utopia himself. Eventually, Xarus led a full-scale attack on Utopia, which was defended by the "Tough Skin" squad, led by Cyclops, Emma, and Blade, the vampire hunter. Assuming her diamond form, Emma was able to effectively battle the vampire hordes because they could not bite her or do any damage. The sheer numbers of Xarus's legion soon overwhelmed the X-Men, and as they prepared to fall back, the vampire Wolverine was sent to kill Scott. It was then that Scott's plan played out, as Logan's healing factor was restored, and he returned to normalcy.

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When Scott Summers and Wolverine visited the United Nations to speak at an International Arms Control Conference, they were surprised to find another mutant in attendance: Quentin Quire, aka Kid Omega. Quentin used his vast psychic powers to force the world leaders in the room to reveal their deepest darkest secrets on live television. This incident sparked worldwide outrage and widespread panic. Mutant hysteria was at an all-time high as world leaders took old models of Sentinels that had been commissioned long ago out of storage. The Sentinels in nearly every country had been reactivated and were on the lookout for mutants. Emma Frost broadcast a telepathic message to every remaining mutant on the planet, warning them about the sentinels, and urging them to lay low. Emma also ran telepathic surveillance with the Stepford Cuckoos as teams were deployed into the field to destroy the sentinels. The old models began to malfunction and began attacking everyone around them - not just humans. Soon thereafter, Quentin Quire turned up on Utopia seeking sanctuary. Wolverine decided against it, but Cyclops allowed him to stay. He was sent to a room, but not without a stern warning from Emma. While most X-Men were out dealing with the Sentinel problem, Emma decided to visit the Museum of Mutant History located elsewhere in San Francisco on the night of its grand opening. The mutant-friendly Mayor Sinclair had invited Cyclops to the event. Cyclops decided to send the Sub-Mariner, Colossus, Iceman, and Magneto with Emma as a show of force to the outside world. While at the museum, Emma notes that she is mentioned barely four times, and in three of them, as a villain. Later, after taking photos, Emma and the X-Men are attacked by Kade Kilgore, his Inner Circle, and their henchmen. Emma's telepathy is blocked by a device activated by Maximilian Frankenstein of Kilgore's Inner Circle. He reveals there is a tiny button hidden away in his glove by his pinkie finger that allowed him to block her powers. Emma simply breaks his finger, reactivating her telepathic powers. Before she has the ability to shut down the invaders, a space slug is attached to her face, incapacitating Emma and the others. With the 'heavy hitters' down, Idie Okonkwo aka Oya, decides, based on Cyclops's orders, to attack the intruders. She burns them alive, all except for Kilgore and his Inner Circle, who escape. This attack sets Wolverine off against Cyclops, saying that it wasn't right for Oya to do what she did. Wolverine blamed Scott, and Scott accepted the blame. By the time the slug was removed from Emma's face, Cyclops and Wolverine had taken down a mega-sentinel that attacked Utopia - with the help of the mutant children.This final battle was what made up Logan's mind. He decided to leave Utopia saying that Cyclops was turning children into soldiers. Scott and Logan invited the rest of the mutants to make up their mind, and choose a side, and reassured them that there would be no hard feelings. Cyclops naturally assumed that Emma would stay on Utopia with him. Emma told him he shouldn't have assumed as much. She revealed that he has forced her to sacrifice everything she believes in, everything she loves to be with him on Utopia. She believed in teaching the next generation, not in fighting. After explaining why she should leave, Emma reveals that she liquidated her company in order to bankroll Utopia since Angel would be leaving. She did it even before Scott asked if she would be staying, showing that she'd already resolved to remain with him.</hero:storyDescription>

She is on Scott's Extinction Team along with Hope, Colossus, Magik, Danger, Magneto, Namor and Storm. Emma and the team are alarmed of the Dreaming Celestial being activated by Mr. Sinister. They engage him in battle and Emma ends up losing one of her diamond arms due to a blast from a celestial probe. Emma and the team fought the Sinister people until Mr. Sinister invites them into to his domain. Sinister telepathically controls the team, but due to being in her diamond form Emma is immune but surrounded. Emma told Hope a code word that replicates Emma's diamond form to protect Hope from Sinister prior to entering his domain. With Sinister shot through the head by Hope thanks to Emma, the team is freed from his telepathic control but Sinister predicts this would happen and the team learns Sinister's copies have become a hive-mind-like species.Emma and the team continue to battle the Sinister Species when Emma realizes that Sinister is using Cyclop's mind as a blueprint for his species. Emma has Namor hold her left arm as a tourniquet and abandons her diamond form where she successfully uses her telepathy to mind blast the Sinisters. However, a new Sinister arrives saying he integrated the new data that the previous Sinisters received, and shoots himself after teleporting his palace away.The Dreaming Celestial's head attaches to its body as the rest of the Celestials land. Emma is about to be told to leave by Scott but cuts him short refusing to go. The team stares the Celestials down vowing to protect the Dreaming Celestial and Earth. A group of people gathers looking at the X-men but they do nothing, no throwing things, no derogatory slurs. They only show fear which was Cyclops' initial plan all along. Emma's diamond arm was eventually reattached by a molecular weaving machine made by X-Club.Emma was seen training, getting back into to fighting condition after her arm reattachment. She had a brief conversation with Namor and left while noticing Scott was on edge about something. She was later deployed with the Extinction team to deal with the escaped prisoners from the Peak space prison station and when the Avengers showed up to deal with further escapees. She teams up with Iron Man, Colossus and Red Hulk to face Xemnu the Titan While Colossus holds off Xemnu, Emma and Tony make a psionic shielding device for the Red Hulk to protect him from Xemnu's telepathy. With the device complete, the combined might of Colossus and Red Hulk was enough to defeat the alien.With Hope taken captive by Unit, the Extinction team takes leave from the Avengers to save Hope. Emma and the team are teleported there by Magik where Emma tries to invade Unit's mind. Unit uses a fake double mind, which is what he used in the first place to make a false mutant detection signal in order to draw out Hope, allowing him the chance to shoot a small laser at Emma stunning her. He then uses a pheromone barrage on her and Namor forcing them to become intimate on the battlefield which makes Scott angry and jealous causing him to blast Unit. With Unit's eventual defeat at the hands of Danger, the team returns home where Emma apologizes to Scott for what happened with her and Namor. He tells her that he was alright with what happened since she was forced to do so and had no choice in the matter.</hero:storyDescription>

She was close to telepathically shutting down the Avenger's mental defenses when Iron Man shows up using a nanotech taser cloud to block her telepathy. Emma is forced into her diamond form and after a brief battle with Iron Man is defeated shortly after until Magneto shows up to battle Iron Man, saving her. After the Avengers have soundly won the Battle of Utopia and Hope has run off, Cyclops surrenders the X-Men. The Avengers become aware that this is just a ruse, as Cyclops has Magik teleport the X-Men away. Emma is with Scott when he visits the Jean Grey School to ask for recruits and sanctuary. A brief battle with Wolverine's X-Men ensues, and the Extinction Team leaves the premises. They find out Hope is heading to the moon. Emma, and four other mutants, Cyclops, Magik, Colossus, and Namor, acquire a share of the Phoenix thanks to Iron Man using a new armor to stop it from bonding with Hope. Emma and the rest of the Phoenix Five take Hope back to Earth in order to prepare for future events. They announce they will cleanse the Earth.Emma and the rest of the Phoenix Five fix the Earth by ending hunger, providing an unlimited source of free, clean energy and water, and also outlaw war 'Pax Utopia'. In order to outlaw war, they destroy all large weapons including sentinels, missiles, submarines, tanks, etc. Emma destroyed sentinels from all around the world. In order to complete this job, she arrived at Avengers Academy to destroy the sentinel belonging to Juston. Despite its being a killing machine, Justin has grown attached to the sentinel and refuses to let Emma destroy it. The students of the Academy step in to prevent Emma from taking the sentinel apart. Hank Pym joins the fray, and together they make a stand against Emma, who easily tosses them around with her new powers. She cannot understand why the students would want to protect a mutant-hunting robot. She is most surprised by X-23 who attacks Emma to defend her friend. Laura is a mutant and Emma believed that she would side with her. Emma was able to thwart Laura's attack by shifting into diamond form. Emma offered to simply wipe the processing unit of the sentinel so that its prime directive to "Destroy all mutants!" would be erased. Juston wouldn't allow this claiming that it would do away with the sentinel's personality. Having been unable to reach a compromise, Emma decided to simply destroy the machine. Rather than melting it, however, she took it apart, so that Justin could rebuild it with a new unit. She melted its core so that it could not be used again. After extending an invitation to X-23 (that was hastily rejected), Emma took her leave of the school. Unbeknownst to her, Quicksilver had switched out the sentinel's unit with his super speed so that the sentinel would be safe after all. Emma's battle at Avengers Academy led to Hank Pym's announcement that the school would be closed because it was unsafe.Later, Emma and Namor talk about Transonic being imprisoned. Namor is disgusted with it and Emma tells him she knows where the girl is. In what appears to be a manipulative moment for Emma, most likely due to the corruption and the power of the part of the Phoenix Force in her, kisses Namor and tells him Transonic is in Wakanda and that she, Emma, hasn't told Scott about her whereabouts.Another scuffle with the Avengers occurs when the Avengers invade a remodeled Utopia (which now ascends all the way into the sky with all new levels of paradise) to snatch away Hope Summers. Emma and Scott prepare to battle the Avengers and permanently end the conflict, but the Scarlet Witch intervenes and teleports a voluntary Hope and the Avengers away. Emma talks with Cyclops who goes on to say that despite all the good X-Men do and all the good they have done, mankind still hates and fears them. That they will always be pushed further into a corner and steal away their innocent despite being endangered so few. The humans will always send their "heroes" to attack the mutants and continue to push them around. She watches as Cyclops simply states "No more Avengers." He plans to take the Avengers off the board, permanently.With Magneto bringing Namor's actions to Scott's attention, he questions Emma. Emma tells him Namor is his own man and that Scott has no authority over him. Emma tells him to look at the benefit of what happened with the Avengers being found. Emma and the rest of the Phoenix Five go to Wakanda wherein Namor's defeat, they absorb his share of the Phoenix Force. Emma calls for a meeting with Scott in the remote location of the Danakil Desert in Ethiopia. Emma and he talk and she go on to say she has reached into every mind on Earth. Scott tells her that she needs to stop sounding like Namor and that this isn't a war and she needs to come home. Emma tells Scott that Hope is in K'un Lun. Scott rushes off to retrieve Hope leaving Emma in mid-sentence begging for him to stop her as she is scared of what she might do next as the Phoenix Force's influence corrupts her further. She ends up making a man who had a hit and runs accident with a thirteen-year-old mutant boy years ago and never reported it just because he was a mutant, brain dead. When Colossus and Magik fight, they manage to knock each other out in an attempt to gain the other's portion of the Phoenix Force. They are returned to their normal forms as their portions of the Phoenix Force leave them and presumably go to Emma and Scott.Emma is now almost completely corrupted by the Phoenix Force. She has forced all the remaining X-Men to bow down and worship her. Only one resisted and that was Magneto. Emma explains that she is indeed the more powerful of the two which spites Magneto to contact Xavier saying both Emma and Scott are completely gone. Scott is in need of more power after his defeat at the hands of Hope taking the power of Iron Fist and Scarlet witch so he is heading after Emma.Emma talks with Scott telling him she can read his thoughts about how he thinks he might take her half. Emma begins to go on on a rant threatening to burn the world but Cyclops yells at her to stop talking like that and asks what has gotten into her. She replies with a worried look that she doesn't know. The Avengers and X-Men attack the two remaining avatars and they fight back. As the fight continues on the outside, Emma and Cyclops have a psychic dinner discussing things. Emma reveals to Scott even more disturbing tendencies such as using human blood as a sauce for a steak. She tells him about the psychic affair and that she truly loves him. She continues to talk about destroying the world and that she will be a queen of ash and they will just rebuild anew. Emma's corruption is almost complete and Cyclops realizes this. He asks for her forgiveness as Emma is stricken down by him and her half of the force is absorbed. Emma is arrested by the Avengers who are then attacked by Purifier being labeled as mutant sympathizers. The Avengers defeat them and then Emma is escorted to prison and the Extinction team is revealed to still be active.</hero:storyDescription>

Emma storms off and Cyclops tells her to read his mind to show her how sorry he really is but Emma reveals she cannot as the Phoenix altered their powers and her telepathy is gone. Emma also tells Scott they best not be near each other and when she was seemingly going to end the relationship right then and there, the cops start heading towards them as Magik teleports the group away. In Australia, a new mutant girl named Eva has just awakened her powers after her overprotective brother started a fight.

With Cyclops pointing out Beast would be the only one, Emma figures it makes sense since Cyclops killed Xavier that with Hank not being able to kill Scott would punish him instead. She shows up with Scott and the group to the Jean Grey Institute to deliver his explanation of what happened in Avengers vs X-Men to clear the air and offer the new students to join his side of things at the new Xavier Institute.Emma recently took Jean Grey to Madripoor after promising to train her in her psionic powers. Emma reveals her psychic powers have been repaired with some help from the Cuckoos, and with it she shuts off Jean's telepathy. She sends Jean after the Blob, and Jean managed to defeat him. Emma congratulates her and tells her she needs to open herself up more and the two head home.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">With the emergence of a new mutant by the name of Fabio Medina, Cyclops and his X-Men team show up to ascertain him to join the New Charles Xavier Institute for the Gifted. Fabio is being detained by the police at the time of his powers awakening and causing a commotion. The X-Men manage to stop the police but are soon attacked by a group of sentinels. The veteran X-Men manage to defeat the sentinels, even with their altered powers with Cyclops delivering the final blow, leveling the entire area as the group stare in amazement at his power. After the defeated sentinels, the revolutionary group of X-Men leave with Fabio and return the new Xavier Institute. Emma has a break down outside and discovers that she is now projecting her thoughts at random. She has a deep conversation with Scott about their current situation. While they agree they are separated, they show they still care about each other and will continue to work with each other for the betterment of the students. They head inside the new school and go over the current mutant situation. The team teleports to Australia to visit Eva Bell's mother, and not long after showing up, the X-Men and recruits are intercepted by an Avengers squad.Emma and Scott stand up to the Avengers with the bold proclamation that the Avengers are the ones responsible for the death of Charles Xavier. After some statements from Cyclops and the Avengers almost assaulting the X team, Eva Bell freezes them in a temporal bubble. Cyclops makes the statement that the X-Men will protect all the mutants and humans that support them and that a warning to the people who will deny them their freedom has been issued. The X team is transported back to the New Xavier Institute where Magneto is revealed to be the mole. The team shows disgust at the reveal except for Emma, who realizes that Magneto being a double agent is an ingenious plan and even convinces Scott it can play to their advantage. Emma, along with the rest of the veteran mutant team, are transported by Magik to the Jean Grey Institute.When they show up to the Jean Grey Institute, Scott goes off on his explanation of his side in the story and in the meantime, Emma confronts the Stepford Cuckoos where they figure out she does not have her telepathy and realize that is why Emma never made contact. The Cuckoos psychically torture Emma to a degree about it and uncover what happened between her and Scott. Emma doesn't blame them for their actions as she does understand they are just like her. Emma and the Cuckoos then have a psychic conversation about the events happening at the school with the original X-Men coming to the future. The Cuckoos do make mention of Jean Grey and that she is still very untrained, as they have been reading her mind quite frequently. Emma tells the Cuckoos to come with her to the Xavier School where she will continue to train them. Emma and the group leave for a period to return to their school and find the new mutants getting attacked by the Danger Room. It is then that Magik's powers show her broken state as she screams out in pain, briefly disappears, and reappears in a small burst of flames. Emma and the veteran X-Men leave once more for the Jean Grey school and upon their return, the Cuckoos have come to the new Xavier Institute along with the younger version of Angel.After Magik's powers go off again, Cyclops has a talk with her and brings her back. Emma, along with the rest of the team, are forcibly pulled into Limbo where Illyana has transformed into Darkchilde.It is revealed that the team was forcibly transported into Limbo by Dormammu so he could kill the team to spite Magik and eventually kill her. Emma transforms into diamond form to keep herself protected and when Dormammu commands his mindless ones to attack the team, Emma gets the Stepford Cuckoos to turn the fearful new mutant's mindsets into bravery, thus giving them to courage to fight back. Emma and the rest of the team fight the minions to save themselves and Magik.Emma continues battling the mindless ones and the group is soon getting overwhelmed with some getting injured. Magik manages to free herself and cast everyone out while absorbing the entire dimension into herself. One of the students, Benjamin, is nearly dead, but Emma coaches Christopher through the use of his ability and saves him. Scott apologizes to the team and tells them they all must train. Emma and Scott escort Fabio home, as he could not handle the pressure that comes with being an X-man. Emma tells the team not to worry as new mutants are popping up all over the world, and the team rescues and recruits a new mutant by the name of David Bond, who has the ability to control cars. Emma is seen coaching David when he is controlling a massive plane just outside of the compound. When Irma of the Stepford Cuckoos dyes her hair, Emma is seen escorting her back inside when Celeste freaks out on her. Emma helps the team invade the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier when they catch word of Fabio being kidnapped and interrogated and the team manages to successfully save Fabio.Emma and Scott are training the students, but the former couple ends up having a small argument. After watching Eva perform a new ability with her powers, Emma and the rest of the X-Men end up watching a pro-mutant rally in honor of Scott. The X-Men go and join the rally where Emma watches Scott give a speech, but not long after a new sentinel attacks them.The Blockbuster sentinel attacks, and appears to vaporize him. Much to worry about Emma, but due to a timely save from Magik, he is alright. Emma goes diamond and charges the machine, only to be knocked back and caught by Angel. The rest of the X-Men try their luck at attacking it, but the sentinel keeps adapting. Eventually, Magneto arrives and does a final attack. The Sentinel appears to ready to explode, and with Cyclops demanding the robot tell him who sent it, Emma saves Scott before it does leave an explosion, but only due to the assailant calling it back.During a training session, Emma watches as Cyclops is being especially hard on Benjamin for giving up in a training exercise. When Benjamin gets out of the shower, Emma is clad in different clothes and begins to get close to the student in an attempt to make him uncomfortable and push him to get his powers to activate. The attempt works as Emma picks up on his traits and comes to the conclusion that he is more than just a shape-shifter, and that he can mess with technology, and that he releases a pheromone of sorts that makes people feel good about themselves. Emma and Magik take him to Atlanta, Georgia where they put his powers to the test. Emma ends up having the student run an actual mission. She hands him a letter and tells Benjamin to bring it all the way up to Timothy Dugan's office with a note telling him that in someone inside SHIELD is attacking mutants. Benjamin ends up passing and Emma tells Scott about his successful mission.</hero:storyDescription>

  <hero:storyDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma Frost was recruited by a mysterious boss during the events of Original Sin to join a team of three that included Ant-Man and the Black Panther. Other teams of two or three were also being formed, and each group led a mini-investigation of the death of Uatu the Watcher. Their investigations would eventually lead all the involved parties to a supposedly secret space station, in which all the teams argued with each other and tried to answer some of their questions. Who had led them there? Who were they working for? And why? Fighting broke out as an enraged Gamora threatened the Winter Soldier who appeared to have murdered Nick Fury. Emma Frost came to his defense, shifting into diamond form, and smashing her fist into Gamora, who returned the blow in kind. Eventually, things cleared up. The Nick Fury that Bucky had "killed" was actually a Life Model Decoy. The real Nick Fury revealed himself to the teams as the mysterious boss that they had been working for. He explained his story to them - that he was the "man on the wall" doing terrible things to defend Earth. He had selected each of them and led them to the space station so that he might choose one of them to become his successor. He believed they each possessed a special and lethal set of skills that would make them right for the job. The Avengers back on Earth soon caught on, and made their way to the space station to investigate. A battle between the Avengers, Fury, and Fury's possible successors ensued. When all was cleared up, and Fury was presumed dead, the heroes, including Emma returned to Earth ... except for Thor, who because of something Fury whispered to him, was unworthy of his hammer, and could no longer lift it.</hero:storyDescription>

They find nothing and head back to the New Xavier School. Emma talks with Scott that he needs to apologize to David for kicking him off the team. Later on, the Jean Grey Institute Staff arrive at Scott's school and tell him that he needs to come with them about Xavier's will. Emma volunteers to go in Scott's place, but they all head to the JGS, and there She-Hulk begins reading the will and announces that Xavier was married to Mystique. Emma ends up being the only one to laugh at the new found revelation. Emma sat and listened with most of the Will as Xavier explained how he was forced to psychically and slowly, lobotomize a young mutant by the name of Matthew Malloy since Xavier could not help him and his powers were too strong to control. After Xavier mentions that this goes against everything he taught the X-Men that no mutant should ever be left behind, but he did to this one, only periodically reinforcing the psychic blocks he built in the child over the years. With Xavier telling them that the rest of the will is to be played after Cyclops and Wolverine, along with Rachel Grey, reinforce the mental blocks on Matthew, Cyclops has an outburst of anger. While he refuses to help Xavier due to being lied to, Emma is the only one who seems to get through to him, and thus, he leaves for Xavier's final request with Emma staying behind at the Jean Grey Institute.Emma is with Kitty and Dazzler when Beast walks in with the rest of the JGS staff to warn them that no one is going to help them, but that SHIELD is planning on attacking and killing Malloy, whom Cyclops is with. Beast gets an update that Scott was killed during an attack on Malloy. Upon hearing this, Emma storms out of the Jean Grey School and onto the lawn, and in her grief, causes a massive psychic projection that harms the staff and students of the school along with the Cuckoos back at the New Xavier School. Matthew Malloy appears on the front lawn in front of her, and Emma asks if he was there with Scott. After he replies yes, Emma punches him, and in reflex Malloy accidentally kills her.After Eva goes back in time to find a younger Xavier, she tells him what is going on, and they fix it by making sure Malloy's parents never conceive Matthew and Eva return back to her timeline, which has then prevented any of the teachers from dying. The will is finished and Scott inherits the Jean Grey School, but he signs it over to Storm and asks for her to take in his students, and all Emma says is Scott just shut down the school.After the events of the Last Will and Testament of Charles Xavier, Scott has shut down his school and transferred the students to the Jean Grey Institute. Emma questions Scott about the revolution and what it truly meant. She suggests they start all over. Scott shoots her down, but Emma reveals her powers have returned and that he is conflicted about her and that she is to him as well.

They are investigating a distress call they received from Muir Island. They discover the death of Multiple Man, and upon further investigation, realize there is a Terrigen Cloud around the island. Shortly afterward, it causes Cyclops to die. Emma then uses her telepathy to make a projection of Cyclops as if he is alive and orchestrates the whole plan of Death of X. The Cuckoos help her project this image of Cyclops to everyone on the entire planet. Emma's projection of Cyclops gives a speech, warning everyone about the toxicity of the Terrigen Mist. She uses this projection to warn the world of the cloud, recruit the mutant known as Alchemist to alter the cloud and destroy one of them. She uses this projection to attack the Inhumans and destroys half of the Terrigen Mists. The Inhuman royals intervene and the projection of Cyclops 'dies' at the hands of Black Bolt, giving Cyclops a meaningful death. Emma later reveals to Havok that Cyclops died before all of this and that she simply wanted to give his death meaning for all that he did for the world.

Behind the scenes, she is working against them. She has stolen a piece of the cosmic cube from Shang Chi and intends on using it against Captain America and Hydra. The members of X-Men Blue, led by the time-displaced Jean Grey and guided in secret by Magneto, attack New Tian believing that Emma is a Hydra villain. Emma's allies confront them, and Cyclops is taken to her citadel. Emma telepathically toys with teenage Cyclops, until the other X-Men come to free him.Eventually, Captain America realizes Emma has a piece of the cube and sends Hydra forces to invade New Tian.

Emma refuses, saying she will go and hand the fragment in herself as a sign of good will, and she will negotiate a cease-fire, not a surrender. She threatens to unleash King Xorn on the Hydra forces if they do not accept her terms. Emma marches into the capital, while the remaining heroes are fighting Hydra forces. The battle looks bleak until Captain America tells Emma he will not allow a ceasefire and will instead attack the mutants. Emma turns on him, promising no mutant will kneel to Hydra, and orders Magneto to tear Captain America's aircraft out of the sky, turning the tide of the battle.When Hydra has been defeated, Emma must once again negotiate with the US government, and the kingdom of New Tian is torn down, by Sentinels, no less, and the population is reintegrated with the United States.</hero:storyDescription>

Her psionic powers allow her to perform several feats such as mental communication, mind reading, mind control, induce paralysis, possession, hypnosis, pain stimulation, illusion casting, astral projection, psychic surgery, and by collecting ambient psionic energy she can create powerful psionic lightning bolts or "psi-bolts", that can attack on a physical or mental level and are capable of rendering a person unconscious or even killing them. Emma's telepathy is powerful enough to communicate and affect people all the way across the planet. She has even done a mental broadcasting of Cyclops' own thoughts to all of the remaining mutants that were left on the Earth. Emma has also displayed psychometric powers, having taught a class of young mutants how to do so, as well. Using her telepathy, she can also psionically shut off another's mutant's telepathy.Emma has been stated to be an "Omega Class Telepath" (the same classification as Charles Xavier), a level 10 psi and one of the top five telepaths on Earth. Emma's telepathy manifested itself in her teens, and she has devoted her life to mastering her many psychic skills. For a period following the death of Jean Grey and the de-powering of Professor Xavier (though he has since regained his abilities), Emma has acted as the X-Men's primary telepath.After utilizing and losing the Phoenix Force post-Avengers vs X-Men, Emma's powers have been altered with her losing most of her telepathy as result. Another side effect of the Phoenix Force altering her powers, Emma now projects her thoughts unto people at random intervals with no control over this change.Despite the initial loss of her telepathy, for awhile Emma only had a modicum of her previous power levels. Emma is still one of the most skilled telepaths on Marvel Earth. In place of her shattered telepathy, she was relying upon on the powers of other telepaths to which she uses her own mind as a conduit for, such as the Stepford Cuckoos' or the young Jean Grey's telepathic powers. This enables her to engage in telepathic battles and make full use of her skill since the younger mutants do not possess the knowledge she does. Emma recently revealed that her broken telepathic powers have been repaired and back at her normal levels due to training with the Stepford Cuckoos.Her power levels have increased to the point where she was able to create and sustain a projection of Cyclops for an extended period of time. She was able to project her thoughts to the entire world, with the aid of the Cuckoos. This projection of Cyclops was even caught on camera, suggesting that Emma's illusions are not just in the mind of her targets.</hero:powerDescription>

She can even psionically shut off another's person's telepathy.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma gained a secondary mutation during the destruction of Genosha, which manifested as complete transmutation of her organic tissues into a diamond-like substance. It was later revealed in a flashback that Cassandra Nova possibly catalyzed Emma's secondary mutation in order to allow her to survive the harsh environment of Genosha (however, it is still questionable if this is really true). This ability allows Emma to turn into an un-living yet sentient and mobile diamond form, granting her extreme resistance to damage, invulnerability to cold and heat, enhanced speed, super strength (no limit has been clearly defined but handbooks say approximately 2 tons), immortality, and limitless stamina as her body does not tire or produce any fatigue toxins while in this form. She also does not feel pain or emotions and has no need to eat, sleep, or drink while in diamond form. A drawback of her diamond form is she can not access her telepathy, but in return, it grants her telepathic immunity to all but a few telepaths. Emma can stay transformed for as long as she likes, and the speed it takes for her to transform in and out of her diamond form is almost instantaneous, being described as happening within a hundredth of a second.Emma's diamond form has stood up to Cyclops' optic blasts, jet crashes, blasts from Bishop, hits from World War Hulk, the collapse of Genosha, a blast from Black Bolt, and even a blast from the Dreaming Celestial's head when it was taken over by Mr. Sinister. Emma can be broken if hit with the appropriate amount of force, appropriate weapon and her shatter point (believed to be somewhere on her forehead). Her first instance of entirely shattering was due to a diamond bullet hitting her in her shatter point at extremely high speeds. In her second instance of breaking (this did not involve her shatter point), Emma's arm was cut off when attacked by one of the Dreaming Celestial's "mini celestial" probes its body broke into. Despite her arm breaking off, this shows an impressive upper limit to the kind of damage her diamond form can take, considering one of them was able to blast a massive hole in Colossus' chest and send him flying across San Francisco.</hero:powerDescription>

  <hero:powerDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">While in possession of part of the Phoenix Force, Emma acquires new powers on top of her old ones. She gains the ability to manipulate the Phoenix' cosmic energy for various purposes such as setting enemies on fire or simply projecting it as energy blasts. She also gains telekinetic capabilities and the ability to fly. Her telepathy has grown in strength as she was capable of reaching into every mind on Earth. She gains a massive strength boost easily putting her in class 100+ as she was able to fight and defeat a Mjolnir wielding Thor without much difficulty using nothing but physical combat. In her diamond form, she becomes almost completely invulnerable as X-23's adamantium claws could not cut her.Perhaps Emma's most unique ability gained from the Phoenix is when Thor "shattered" her, (it is possible Emma feigned Thor actually shattering her considering she was playing with him the entire fight) she had conscious control over all the fragments and rained them down through him and then reformed herself, showing Emma in her diamond form combined with the Phoenix Force is possibly unkillable. Despite her new found powers, Emma is not without weakness. Special Shi'ar weaponry, the Iron Fist energy from K'un-Lun and the Scarlet Witch's chaos magic have all been shown to harm them. However, as the Avatars gained more power when one falls, the Scarlet Witch's magic has grown to be less and less effective. As she gained more and more power, the Phoenix's corrupting influence over Emma grew stronger and stronger.</hero:powerDescription>

Her persuasive manner and abilities can easily sway others to do anything in her favor, especially when this skill is backed up with her telepathy.Emma has also spent a great deal of time mentoring young mutants, granting her tremendous knowledge in mutant powers and how they work. When she possessed Iceman's body, she was able to use his powers in ways he had never been capable of before. Emma was the one that discovered Cyclops' inability to control his optic blasts was actually the result of mental blocks that Scott imposed on himself at a young age (and not physical brain damage, as was previously believed) and performed 'psychic surgery' that allowed him to control his powers for a time.</hero:powerDescription>

Emma has fended off humans turned into lizard-like creatures without the need of her powers and also managed to fight well against a lizard-turned Wolverine, Gambit, and Storm in diamond form before Spider-Man showed up to help her. When she was a teacher for Generation X, Banshee planned to surprise Emma with an attack, but she quickly and easily thwarted him without the use of her powers, displaying her skill at unarmed combat even before she received official X-Men training in the area.</hero:powerDescription>

Her brother, the only family member who cared about her, became a drug addict and tried committing suicide(thanks to his father's horrible treatment of him), and when she thought things would be better for her, her friend was killed in front of her, another friend was a bitch who manipulated her, and her Love Interest dumped her because she was a mutant. She also used to enjoy torture, mind-rape, followed by setting hunting dogs on the nightly victims (yes, really), corporate corruption, manipulation, deceit, and forcing opponents to kill themselves during her villain years. Shaw required her to help killing her two best friends to become White Queen.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:tropeDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Scott Lobdell's version had almost nothing in common with the Corrupt Corporate Executive supremacist Mind Rape Cold-Blooded Torture fetishist that she used to be. Instead, she became a excellent teacher doing genuinely good actions while feeling good about it. However, later in Generation X, she was strongly hinted to have murdered a police officer looking into her sister's death (at Emma's hands). Grant Morrison and some other writers returned her closer to her roots again, according to some it made her more interesting, but played her as a complete hedonistic Jerkass, which sat badly with those who were introduced to her through Generation X, because it put all the Character Development she had during seven years in a trash bin. Later other writers attempted to either return her to the less extreme portrayal or attempt to integrate the two. How villainous she is post-Inhumans vs. X-Men tends to vary wildly. One comic might portray her as a genocidal lunatic, and the next she'll be palling around with Iceman or flirting with Jessica Jones.</hero:tropeDescription>

Emma's Control Freak of a father gets the teacher fired (and forbids him from ever seeing Emma again). They later meet again when Emma ends up attending a college where he is teaching. There the teacher, Emma, her telepathic roommate, and Emma's new best friend get involved in a love rectangle where the roommate telepathically manipulates the best friend into accusing Emma of sexual advances in order to remove the two people standing between her and Emma. In response to this revelation, Emma mind wipes her roommate, then uses her own psychic power to hijack her best friend's mind and make everyone think she's a lying, crazy stalker. Afterward, Emma confesses to Ian what she did in order to protect him, in the name of being honest with the man she loves in hopes that he would not hold it against her in the event he wanted to begin a relationship with her at last. Unfortunately, finding out that Emma was a mutant AND had used her psychic powers to get her best friend labelled insane causes him to reject Emma, turning her into the cold-blooded villain she would become.</hero:tropeDescription>

  <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma appears as one of the main characters in the series, voiced by Kari Wahlgren.Uninvited, Emma Frost first appears at the mansion's front door seeking to join the X-Men. Wolverine refuses her, but is eventually forced to accept her into the team since she is the only telepath available and therefore the only one able to operate Cerebro. She successfully located Charles Xavier's lifeless body in the heart of Magneto's Genosha, but later attempts to locate Jean Grey were less successful. In an effort to remain on the team she informs Cyclops that 'given time I could locate her, but if [Wolverine] has his way I'll be gone tomorrow'. Frost is intelligent and tactical, and is an extremely powerful telepath. Her first telepathic fight as an X-Man was against the Shadow King. Storm had been manipulated into believing that Africa was burning and used her mutant powers to put the fires out. However, in reality she was tearing the country apart with rain storms and tornadoes.It was Emma's telepathic powers that saved Storm's life, the whole continent of Africa, and eventually defeat the Shadow King. Later on she was able to disable Psylocke's telepathic attacks with relative ease. Despite Wolverine's initial distrust of Frost, he has grown to accept her as a permanent member of the team.Her battle against the Shadow King and her success to mend some of Wolverine's memories of his time in Weapon X have earned his respect. However, she is extremely secretive and on one occasion lied to Wolverine about Forge's availability. She also appears to be fond of Cyclops, often watching him from afar. Cyclops is still depressed for the loss of Jean Grey. Emma offered to delete his memories of Jean and make him normal again.Emma betrays the X-Men after Jean is found. It is revealed that she has been working for the Inner Circle in an attempt to destroy the Phoenix Force. The Inner Circle then double crosses Emma and tries to use the Phoenix for their own ends. It, however proves too powerful for them to control. When the Phoenix Force is released and is searching for Jean, Emma traps it in her body, transforms into diamond and projects it into the atmosphere where it cannot find a host. She manages to ask Cyclops to forgive her before shattering and seemingly dies.X-Men (2012)In the Japanese X-Men anime, Emma is found to by the Astonishing X-Men (Beast, Cyclops, Logan and Storm) in a pod next to Armor in the U-Men Lab. It is revealed that Emma was kidnapped by the U-Men while searching for Hisako, her missing student. After copping the blame for forcing Jean Grey to commit suicide as Dark Phoenix, Emma joins the X-Men as to continue her tutelage of Armor. She even goes as far as allowing Xavier to view her mind and broadcast her life to the X-Men to gain Cyclops' trust.As the series goes on she is shown to care for younger mutants and enjoys teaching the next generation, a more motherly aspect - but still retains her ever-observant and cunning personality.Whilst Emma is shown to use both her Telepathy and Diamond Form, she lacks any of the hand-to-hand combat training and relies heavily on her Diamond Form to take a more defensive position in the team. She is voiced by Kaori Yamagata in the Japanese version, and by Ali Hillis in the English dub.</hero:mediaDescription>

  <hero:mediaDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emma Frost appears in the 2011 film, X-Men: First Class and is portrayed by January Jones. She is shown to be the White Queen of the Hellfire Club lead by Sebastian Shaw. She is first shown when Moria MacTaggert sneaks into the Hellfire Club's quarters looking for Colonel Hendry. She is next seen going to meet with a Russian general who Shaw is supposed to meet. Professor Xavier and Magneto also infiltrate the building Emma is in and confront her. She is then captured and taken to the CIA headquarters. Months later, Magneto and his Brotherhood free her from her prison and ask her to join them, to which she agrees. She displays incredibly impressive telepathy defeating and blocking out Charles Xavier several times. She also possesses her diamond form which seems to augment her strength (she was able to send Erik flying into the sea with a single blow) and renders her immune to telepathy. However it does not seem to provide her any physical durability as Erik almost killed her by strangling her with the metal railing of a bed while she was in diamond form (a close up clearly shows it beginning to shatter around the area the pressure was applied, her neck) and Charles had to persuade him not to kill her, which he surely would have. In this incarnation, Emma seems to play more of a henchman-type second-in-command role rather than more of an equal power player as she was in the comics when she was the White Queen.</hero:mediaDescription>
