Emma Frost has transitioned from one of the X-Men's deadliest foes into a central figure on the side of the mutants. Her first era presented her as a leader in the Hellfire Club, but this ended when the manic time traveler Fitzroy appeared from the future, resulting in the deaths of many of her Hellions and putting Emma into a coma. Her involvement in the Phalanx Covenant arc led her to become co-teacher of the new Generation X team with Banshee. Later, after the end of the Generation X series, when the Sentinels devastated Genosha she gained a new power - her diamond form. Subsequent story arcs made her Cyclops' new partner and lover, and a former co-leader of the X-Men. She continues to play a prominent role in Cyclops' teams.
