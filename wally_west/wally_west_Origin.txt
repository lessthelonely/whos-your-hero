Wally West was the nephew of Iris West, fiance of Barry Allen, who was (unknown to her at the time) the Flash of Central City. Wally grew up in a small town called Blue Valley with emotionally distant parents, and dreamed of living in Central City and perhaps one day meeting his hero, The Flash. Wally was only close to one relative, his father's sister, Iris.One summer, Iris offered to let Wally stay in Central City with her. Wally gladly took the chance to get out of his hometown and away from his parents, and looked forward to the excitement of the big city. Iris introduced Wally to Barry, whom Wally thought was dull and uninteresting until Barry offered to introduce Wally to the Flash.Barry used some simple super-speed tricks to pull off the double identity, and gave Wally the surprise of his life. In Barry's lab, the Flash told Wally about how he had gotten his powers - a stray bolt of lightning that hit a rack of chemicals, which in turn hit him.A bolt of lightning struck chemicals which spilled on Wally granted him super-speed powers similar to Barry's, the exact same way in which Barry received his powers. Wally would later find out that the Speed Force used these accidents as a cover to grant super-speed powers to both him and Barry.Barry revealed his dual identity to Wally, and a new partnership was forged. Wally became Flash's sidekick, Kid Flash. Initially, Wally wore a costume mirroring Barry's. As a strategic decision during a battle, Flash altered Wally's costume to a primarily-yellow design. After the battle, Wally chose to keep the costume, and wore it through his whole career as Kid Flash.
